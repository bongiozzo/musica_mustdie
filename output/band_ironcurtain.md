---До сих пор не знаю, действительно ли были Artillery в СССР. На оф сайте есть их фотка с Красной площади---<BR><BR>Вот какую информацию я имею на этот счёт:<BR><BR>---А единственный концерт в Союзе они дали осеню 1989 года в Ташкенте. Хотя здесь куча противоречений и неточностей. Сам опрашивал ташкентских товарищей, так утверждали, что группа таки у них выступала тогда в каком-то ДК, но живых свидетелей шоу не нашлось.<BR>Дело было так. Летели "Артиллеристы" в Москву и Питер, чтоб там дать по концерту. Но в аэропорту нажрались, и занесло их в Узбекистан... Ну и композиции с 90-года все помнят.<BR>И вот кусок интервью кого-то из учатсников группы. К сожалению, оригинал не сохранился, так что копирую с текстовичка и без всяких опознавательных данных =((( И упомянута уже Алма-Ата.<BR>Цитата:<BR>Q: Would you mind sharing your experiences of playing in the Soviet Union in 1989? Where exactly were you playing, can you remember? It seems our authorities were aware of what could be expected from you and the fans at your gigs even before that tour started, so you were not allowed to play in the central cities like Leningrad, Minsk, Moscow, etc. Anyway, wasn't it an unforgettable experience for you to ram through the "iron curtain" and play in front of your Soviet fans?<BR>A: "Wow, this is going to be a long one… We started our "touring" in the Sovjet by playing two gigs in a town called Alma Ata, close to the Chinese and Mongolian border. The two shows were recieved with a mixture of reactions, from the "get up and get out" attitude for the elder Russians, to the screams from totally wild teenagers ready to rage on the place. It was actually great fun! Next stop was Tashkent, as you probably know, very close to the Afghanistan border, and therefore at the time crowded with military personnel and equipment. The difference was very obvious, and we couldn't help noticing that things were a bit more serious down there. But we had two gigs in Tashkent as well, and the vision was even more extreme: We were the third of four bands, the first two bands were like a New Wave band, and a Garage Rock-band, so the elder Russians were "sorted" out. When we entered the stage it was as silent as a tomb… totally darkness… and then we let Hell break loose as we usually did, the lights were on… First there was a sort of shock in their faces, and then they started jumping around, heavier and heavier, faster and faster… wow man… then some of them started to enter the stage, but were taken down by officials, but there were only a few of them, and there were a lot of kids, so eventually the kids won and entered the stage in a huge number. Normally we would expect them to stagedive the hell outta there, but not this lot, no, they stayed on the stage, and their number fast increasing, so much that after a short while we (the band) couldn't see each other, and it was a BIG stage, it was pretty awesome…!! And that was only the first day!!! So we were told that the Politbureau had announced that we were decadent and that we would not be allowed to play in Usbekistan ever again. And the next day we were, instead of going on a plane to fly to our next planned destination, we were put on a train for Moscow. The trip was supposed to take 2 days, but when we woke up on the second day we were travelling in the opposite direction…??? We were actually never told the exact reason for our sudden detour, which brought us to the Trans Siberian line, but the outcome of it all was that we ended up travelling by train for five days…!!! And then, when we got to Moscow, naturally all the gigs we were supposed to play there were cancelled due to the delay… But you're absolutely right, it was an unforgettable experience…---<BR><BR>(с)
