He was supposed to replace the group's original member, David Ellefson, who was unable to take part in HAIL!'s upcoming touring activities due to his renewed collaboration with MEGADETH. At the time, Paul Gray stated about his involvement with HAIL!: "This is going to be amazing! After I heard the news about David reuniting with MEGADETH I touched base with Andreas and everything fell into place pretty immediately. I was excited about what they were doing and their whole attitude is just cool, old school camaraderie and fun and I wanted to share that with them. Fortunately, I had this window of time available as SLIPKNOT are on break so the timing worked perfectly. These guys have been through it all and they represent true metal brotherhood. I like that and I'm glad to now b<BR>e a part of it. I can't wait, I wish we'd leave tomorrow. These shows are going to kick ass!" <BR><BR>Бля...ну что ж творится-то???(((((((((((((((((.Только-только я от шока от смерти Дио отошел (хотя помнить всегда о нем буду) и тут на тебе новая потеря(((((((
