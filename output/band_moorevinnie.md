We did this one at Kajem Studios just outside of Philadelphia in January 1988. It was incredible working with keyboardist Jordan Rudess who now plays with Dream Theater. He plays some absolutely amazing stuff. It was great to feed off of his musical energy. 
Recording this CD was also a challenge because there is around 60 minutes of music, and as with Mind's Eye, we didn't have nearly enough time. We did it in 18 or 20 days. 
As Time Slips By is one of my favorite songs that I have ever written. I rarely listen to my own music, but when I hear this one, I still feel moved by the emotion. When I was choosing songs for The Maze Tour in April 1999, I listened through some tunes from this CD. It was the first time I had heard it in probably 9 years. I have to say that it was definately an "intense" record. For whatever reason, however, no songs from Time Odyssey made it into the set. An oversight on my part which I have been reminded of by fans on the Guest Page. Sorry. I promise that on the next tour I will do something from this CD. 





### "Meltdown" 1991, Instrumental

Players: 
Bass - Greg Smith 
Drums - Joe Franco 
Guitar - Vinnie Moore 


This was a big change in musical direction for me. I felt like I had already done so much of the classically influenced stuff that it was time to explore some new musical territory. I also did not want to be limited by the boundaries of one specific style. I tend to get bored if I do the same thing over, and so it was time to express some different influences.  
I know that this CD alienated some of the hardcore neoclassical fans, but it was important for me to grow and explore as an artist. 
The writing for the first two CDs was more of a serious, composed cerebral process. When writing tunes for Meltdown, I found myself not consciously thinking about composing songs, but instead just playing and letting the ideas flow naturally. This is the way I always write music now--let the music flow from the emotions without thinking about it. It is much more inspirational for me this way. As soon as I am consciously aware that I am writing, it is difficult to be inspired and creative. Letting the songs write themselves is more magical. 
After recording this record, I played guitar for Alice Cooper for several months on the "Operation Rock & Roll" tour before touring extensively with my own band. It was amazing to have so much success with Meltdown on radio stations. The Meltdown music video was in rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. Pretty cool. I am considering making the Meltdown video available for purchase from this site but will have to think about it some more. 
One of the highlights of the Meltdown tour was opening up for Rush on their Roll the Bones tour which included playing at my hometown arena, The Spectrum, in Philadelphia. That was a dream come true. We also did two shows at Madison Square Garden. 
Brian Tichy (now with Ozzy Osbourne) played drums on the tour and J.D. DiServio played bass. Both are incredible musicians. 
This tour lasted for seven months and was probably the most fun that I ever had on a tour. It was always comical hanging with J.D. because besides being a phenomenal bassist, he is also one hilarious dude. We went out to eat Mexican food once, and as result he wrote a song called, Chimi Chimi Changa which became our sound check tune. Funny as shit!

12 Winter Sun 1:57 (Moore, Vinnie) 


Players: 
Bass - Dorian Heartsong 
Drums - Brian Tichy 
Guitars - Vinnie Moore 


This record continued in the more song-oriented approach that I had taken with Meltdown. I had tons of songs to choose from for this CD as I had written about 20 different tunes. There were many things going on in my life at the time which had a huge influence on this record. It was very moody. 
It was a lot of fun experimenting with different moods and textures when writing this record. I recorded the two acoustic songs, Winter Sun and She's only Sleeping in my own studio. This was the first time that I had released something that was recorded in my studio and it proved to me that this was possible to do with great results. I really like the song, Echoes. It was great to have the freedom to be creative and write things from out of nowhere (so to speak) such as Am I only dreaming?. In some ways, this was a little bit of an experimental record for me. 
Unfortunatley, there are some very bad memories for me regarding this CD. I had initially recorded it in December of 1993 for a major record label (that I will not mention), and it was scheduled to be released in April of 1994. In March of 1994, I found out that the label did not want to release it because they decided that they did not want to be involved with a guitar-oriented record because guitar records were not "in style" anymore. I was told that I could get a new label to release the CD. But when I found a new label, the original record company wouldn't let us buy back the record even though they were not going to release it. Totally inhumane! 
So, weeks turned in to months. My manager eventually got someone at the old label to agree to sell the new label the recordings. But at this time, TWO YEARS had gone by! Out of Nowhere was finally released in April 1996. It was devastating to have someone steal something that I had worked so hard on and was so close to. This was definately the low point of my career; it was a very disappointing thing to have to experience. There are some good, moody tunes on this, and I am grateful that it did finally get released.
