2 крашер:<BR><BR>Remembering Dimebag<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I still can't believe it.<BR><BR>To say that Machine Head were devastated... there aren't even words. We<BR>found out about this unbelievable event while in Zagreb, Serbia. The sports<BR>arena we were playing had no phone lines, no internet, virtually zero cell<BR>reception, no TV, no heat. We had nothing but patchy info for the next few<BR>days as we played more shows in Eastern Europe, and frustration started to<BR>boil. It was impossible to call anyone, check e-mail, anything. It's only now that<BR>I've finally been able to sit down and read everything surrounding what<BR>happened.<BR><BR>That night, we dedicated "Descend The Shades Of Night" to Dimebag, a man who<BR>inspired us in so many ways. I lost it on stage. We all lost it on stage.<BR>It's horrible. Things like this just don't happen. Musicians don't get<BR>KILLED on stage... while they're PLAYING... what the fuck? What the fuck is<BR>wrong with people?<BR><BR>Dimebag was one in a million. He was the Randy Rhoads, the Jimi Hendrix of<BR>our time. I'm not gonna try and make it look like Dime and I were best<BR>buddies, we weren't... but I would certainly call him a friend. I met<BR>Dimebag for the first time on Ozzfest in '97. He invited Logan and I into<BR>their dressing room, and I remember being so fuckin' stoked to be hanging<BR>out in the Pantera dressing room, like I had made it into some cool guy<BR>club. I loved Pantera, and tried my hardest to mask my excitement... I<BR>didn't do a very good job, 'cause Darrell kept coming up to me and saying<BR>"Damn dude, you look like you're doin' all right!", and all I could muster<BR>in the moment was "...yeah". He offered me a gazillion shots of whiskey<BR>that day, and over the next couple of months we hung out... not a lot, as I<BR>tried not to be a fan boy, but I couldn't help it, they were fucking<BR>amazing.<BR><BR><BR>

Jazz, Comedian)<BR><BR>В отличии от ЕдгУя сия звездная команда нарулила весьма презентабельную музыку, не шедевральную, но весьма крепкую, в духе ХОРОШЕГо италопавера. С одной стороны немного однообразно, но с другой мелодии и риффы весьма симпатичны и не скучны. Как бы все по делу. Так что желающим на заметку - возможно проект прошел мимо вашего внимания. Альбом вышел днями.<BR><BR>  <BR>  <BR>
