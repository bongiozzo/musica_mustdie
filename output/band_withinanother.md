<P> Within AnotheR is a Hudson Valley, New York-based metal band with a sound that can be described as dark, aggressive, progressive and melodic. Foregoing keyboards in favor of guitar-heavy aggression, the band mixes intense rhythmic dynamics with healthy doses of harmony, melody and layered chords that bring to mind bands like Nevermore, Fates Warning, Soilwork and beyond. Their foray into the gray area between aggressive heavy metal and prog has made them accessible to audiences who ordinarily steer clear of prog-metal as well as those who like their music complex and challenging. "We incorporate a bit of technique without flying over anyone's heads," explains guitarist/vocalist Dean Sternberg. "Everything we do has a dark, moody vibe and at least a few hooks to grab onto. Good songwriting is our number one priority."</>
<P> Formed in the spring of 2001, WithinAnotheR was originally intended to be Sternberg's one-man recording project, which was a result of not being able to find like-minded musicians in the Hudson Valley to form a band. Chuck Naccarato, an accomplished drummer who once toured with Leviathan recording artist/guitarist John Hahnword about WithinAnotheR continues to spread, the band is gearing up for the stage and plans to record another CD in, agreed to play on the demo and record it at his home studio. Things clicked rather well and Chuck handled the complex arrangements with ease, but neither thought the project would ever evolve beyond the studio or two members.</>
<P> "Within another we find ourse <BR> The addition of bassist Mike Poplees came about in June, 2001 when Dean came across an ad in a local magazine submitted by a bassist looking to join a progressive metal band. In an area with very little metal in the way of bands or support, finding a capable bassist with the same musical vision was nothing short of miraculous.</>
<P> With the intention of recording first and playing live later, the trio recorded "Conflict With Reason" at Chuck's studio right after Mike joined. A band webpage was built and the song was put up as an MP3. The reaction was immediate and word about the band spread throughout the web, attracting more visitors. Before long labels were requesting material, tours were offered and zines from around the world were seeking interviews and demos for review. With mounting attention coming from all sides, the band set about recording a proper demo. The result was a 26-minute, four song EP which has earned WithinAnother positive reviews in several music publications and airplay on various online and offline radio stations.</>
