Skull Session is a band with a simple plan.&nbsp; Bringing the heavy, furious nature of thrash and speed metal back to the ears of the metal community with a vengeance.&nbsp; In a time where commercial appeal and integrity have become inversely proportional, Skull Session is based around riff-oriented, aggressive music reminiscent of the earlier days of metal but with a palatability for those less inclined to embrace such sonic intensity.<BR><BR>The brainchild of ex-Whiplash lead guitarist and vocalist Warren Conditi, Skull Session has from the beginning set out to prove that metal fans deeply desired some alternative to the groove-laden pseudo-metal flooding the airwaves as of late.<BR><BR>After recording two albums and undertaking a European tour with the New Jersey thrash legends, Conditi took some time off from writing and recording.&nbsp; It was during this time he decided to find an outlet for his music, which fused his own style of NWOBHM influenced playing with the breakneck tempos and precision of thrash and speed metal. Conditi knew that Skull Session would be exactly what he wanted it to be: fast, heavy, aggressive, precise and standing on its own, not in anyone's shadow.<BR><BR>Conditi recruited Dennis Staub, an accomplished guitarist and songwriter as well as a longtime friend of Conditi's who as well, shared the desire to create music with integrity and fire that would be impossible to ignore. Conditi and Staub had worked together in the past, and had a long musical relationship spanning over a decade. Staub, formerly of Cranial Intrusion had discussed their musical ideals which never seemed to materialize externally through other artists. When approached by Conditi, it soon became obvious to the duo that the realization of their musical ideals would be achieved best by them.<BR><BR>After a few discussions about the increasingly stale musical climate and Conditi's and Staub's growing unrest musically, inevitably, the creation of what was to become Skull Session began to take shape.<BR><BR>With a wealth of material already written, the process of completing the lineup for the band became priority.&nbsp; While revisiting an online resource for musicians, Conditi came across an ad for a Progressive metal bassist who was looking for a serious project to join.&nbsp; After hearing only moments of a well produced piece of music, Conditi immediately attempted to contact him.&nbsp; Mike Poplees, formerly of WithinAnotheR had placed the ad only days earlier and had the energy, style, and rock solid chops Conditi knew would be the perfect fit for Skull Session's brand of razor-sharp metal.&nbsp; In Conditi's mind, the choice of Poplees as a candidate was easy.&nbsp; The hard part would be actually making this a reality.<BR><BR>After hearing some samples of material, Poplees showed a definite interest in becoming Skull Session's new bassist.&nbsp; The three met and played for just a short while during which two entire songs were worked on as if the trio had been rehearsing for weeks if not months already.<BR><BR>Poplees had secured his place with the group and Skull Session was one step closer to becoming what they had envisioned: the ideal metal machine. A ferocious, relentless force like a huge storm looming in the distance, but slowly and steadily moving closer and growing in intensity.<BR><BR>
