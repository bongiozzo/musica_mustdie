### 10.11.2002 reviews Dark, dreary, depressive, dismal… all starting with ‘d’

<p>It was supposed to be just another drinking session with a couple of long time pals. And everything began as if nothing would happen. Nothing unnatural. Well, I guess I made a mistake playing this CD, since all the chatting suddenly went off in order to be interrupted by a hysteric laughter. I guess I must have told you those pals weren’t just my regular boon companions, but musicians. Good ones. Man, they almost laughed their heads off. Sadly enough, that drinking session I was talking about, was doomed to fail shortly thereafter. I hear someone asking me to stop mocking. Ok. Let it be the way you want. I just wanted to warn you: please, don’t play this CD if you’re not all alone. Otherwise, that would quite a regretful experience. Afterall, A.A.WALD aren’t that bad. Let us not forget they were only two whilst crafting this work. Unfortunately, these two aren’t the best musicians around, nor they’re really good singers. Nevertheless, creating a darkly unique atmosphere is where these guys succeeded at. They describe it as ‘psycho rock / dark metal’; truly a good definition… which, at the same time, doesn’t tell the potential listener almost anything in regards to the music A.A.WALD deliver. Well, I guess both ‘gothic metal’ and ‘black metal’ fit here well. Gothic rock also might work well for a couple of songs and passages. Dark, dreary, depressive, dismal… all starting with ‘d’… DEINONYCHUS also starts with ‘d’, by the way. Got the point? A.A.WALD may be as well compared to such combos as VED BUENS ENDE and BETHLEHEM. If they only spent few more hours a day practicing instead of composing… Atmospherically, this one’s superior, though.</p>
