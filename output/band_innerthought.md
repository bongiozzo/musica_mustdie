А вот что поместил в Лефэевкий гестбук их вокалист:<BR><BR>Im so very sorry! But there has always been a 6th member of Morgana Lefay/Lefay, and Some of us are really fed up with him. His name is Mr. Alcohol. I have always put the music in the first room. Hopefully we can reunite one day when Mr. Alcohol is out of the band!? Im not the one that say no to a good party. But there has to be a limit! I moan and I weap. My heart aches. This band is my soul where I have been able to express my inner thoughts and fantasies. I love the members of Lefay and former Morgana Lefay. I love all of you guys and girls who cares about us! I hope that you can forgive, or at least understand. Carpe diem!!!!....I will! C-ya!
