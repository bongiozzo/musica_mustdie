### 04.12.2001 news APOLLYON SUN, featuring former CELTIC FROST mainman Tom Gabriel Fischer, are currently composing ...

<p>APOLLYON SUN, featuring former CELTIC FROST mainman Tom Gabriel Fischer, are currently composing and demoing new material for the group’s upcoming sophomore full-length album at the band’s own rehearsal studio facility (where the act have just upgraded the computer-based recording system) and at Oakland Recording, the group's long-time home when recording in Switzerland. These new works are being produced by AS guitarist/programmer Erol Unala and Fischer, and engineered and co-produced by long-time AS engineer Walter Schmid. Among much other AS work, Schmid has in the past been closely involved with APOLLYON SUN's "Dweller" remix (on the Sub album) and with the CELTIC FROST reissue CDs. A number of musical guests from both sides of the Atlantic have already participated in the above-mentioned sessions. <BR><BR> The material so far completed reportedly ranges from more rock-oriented and organic than 2000's Sub album to rather adventurous and daring ideas. Among the working song titles set to appear on the upcoming CD are the following: <BR><BR> 01. Solitary Lodge <BR> 02. Nova <BR> 03. Deep Inside <BR> 04. All Gone Dead <BR> 05. The Beautiful End <BR> 06. Mouthful of Lies <BR> 07. Apple on a Tree <BR> 08. Winter <BR> 09. Smallwood Red Cheek <BR> 10. Lagrange Point <BR> 11. Superbug<BR><BR> Some of the material written this year for the new AS album will still undergo significant development, while other songs have been recorded to final album standards. All material is being circulated on a variety of work-in-progress CDs within the AS camp and for AS industry associates, and some of this material may soon available via the group’s official web site at www.apollyonsun.com.<BR><BR> Erol Unala and Tom Gabriel Fischer are also currently involved with extensive preparation work for another, as-yet-undisclosed musical project, which, if it will bear fruit, will be of major significance. If given a go-ahead, the project’s details will be officially announced sometime during 2002.</p>
