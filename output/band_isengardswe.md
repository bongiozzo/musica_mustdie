<P><SPAN lang=EN-GB>-<I>After all these years of playing together with Goat it's a great loss for me as the guitar player to find someone else that almost played what i wanted before i even told him, and as a highly skilled composer I sure will miss him but there is a time when you have to let the personal life take the first place in life. Good luck to your future plans and you know that you always will be a part of Isengard</I> says <B>Ronnie Andrйson</B>.</SPAN></P>
