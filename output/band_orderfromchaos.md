Hello!<BR> <BR>NIHILISTIC HOLOCAUST is searching for bands to appear on a sampler, to cover only the earlier VOПVOD material! When this band was playing fukk off Death thrash metal mayhem! The covered songs would have to be taken from the "War an pain" Lp or earlier Demo recordings! To revive the early days of Fukking death!<BR>I want only Brutal, nasty, speed as fukk covers, Total thrash or Death metal! Don't ask me why there can't be covers taken from the following VOПVOD Lps. (Tracks from "RRROOOAAARRR" can eventually be accepted).<BR><BR>The production would have to be decent, at least 8 tracks recorded.<BR><BR>Here are the sheduled bands: <BR>MAUSOLEUM - Condemned to the gallows. <BR>CHEMIKILLER - Voпvod. <BR>DECEASED - Blower. <BR>EFORCE - Nuclear war. <BR>ORDER FROM CHAOS - War and pain. <BR>NOMINON - Live for violence. <BR>DELIRIUM TREMENS - Suck your bone. <BR>INCINERATOR - Iron gang.<BR><BR>It would probably be released as a tape or a CDr.<BR><BR>If you are interested, contact me: gabsk@wanadoo.fr<BR>For more infos, visit: www.nihilistic.ca.tc
