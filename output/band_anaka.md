<p>AnAkA is a heavy metal/ hard rock band from Brooklyn, New York with its musical influences ranging from Metallica to Alice In Chains and Black Sabbath. AnAkA was orginally formed in 2000 but has quickly established a fan base in the NY underground heavy metal and hard rock seen aswell as the rest of the U.S.A.. AnAkA has performed and has also headlined historic and world famous N.Y.C. rock venues such as CBGB's, The Continental, L'Amour, Castle Heights, etc., and they can be described as being a very powerful live band, who can move their audience sonically, physically, and even psychologically. AnAkA's music off of "Down Devil's Road," has been played and requested on national radio stations here in the United States. Along with making a well respected name for themselves in the U.S. underground hard rock/ heavy metal world, AnAkA is ranked the #1 most requested band and #1 album on the European radio station CRETE FM, in turn AnAkA has started building a strong fan base in Europe. AnAkA, "Down Devil's Road" is the bands first studio album, and it contains 7 kick ass heavy and heart felt tracks. AnAkA's music is rage, heartbreak, self realization, love, honor and wisdom ... powerful music for the outlaw-thinker that is found in all of us. AnAkA is currently in the studio working on AnAkA, "Rust & Jade," the bands second studio album, which is due to be released Spring 2003. The members of AnAkA strongly believe that "Rust & Jade" will show the rest of the music world what AnAkA is truly all about. AnAkA has also signed with GODSEND RECORDS, and the band strongly feels that this label is just what they were looking for, one that would let AnAkA continue to AnAkA. For band info, show dates, band pictures, contact info, and for info about purchasing AnAkA, "Down Devil's Road" or to get up-dates about AnAkA, "Rust & Jade," please visit the band at www.AnAkA.net, which is AnAkA's official website.</p>
