### Новый альбом Watchtower

Impaler 03.03.2001 01:03:
Вот что там пишут на сайте:<BR><BR>Since the reunion shows, the Germany show, and the warm ups, as well as the two Dream Theater shows we did, it's been nothing but write songs for a new release. After all these years, here we are working on a new WatchTower CD.  I would say about half of the CD is written.  Doug is writing the lyrics as we speak...ssshhhhhh! do not disturb him, for I am the one who has to sing these words!<BR><BR>So, there is not much to tell.  We were offered to play a show with Fates Warning, and Planet X, but Fates cancelled, and we wanted to do our own show when we have new stuff ready.  So, til that time arrives, you gotta chew what you got already. Keep the guestbook entries coming! and thanx for the lifelong support to WatchTower!<BR>

### А вот че думают буржуины про отечественную продукцию

Mental Home - Upon The Shores of Inner Seas<BR>Released - 2000, Century Media Records | Rating: 3/5 | Reviewer: EvilG <BR><BR>Mental Home are from Russia. I had to get that out first because I can't think of any band I've reviewed so far that are from Russia! The beginnings of this band date back to 1993 when the band were playing doomy death metal. This is the bands fifth album, their first licensed by Century Media and the first that I've heard from them.  <BR><BR>Most, but not all, of Mental Home's death/doom vestiges have been cast aside. In places the music can sound confused because of this. The opening two songs on the CD are by far the strongest. They are "Downstairs" and "Late To Revise." Both are up-tempo with killer drumming and riffing. The vocals are different from many other bands. They are not brutal nor are they overly melodic. I think they are OK but need the most work out of all the other elements. The keyboards are prominent in the mix, giving an atmospheric and almost gothic feel. Track three, "Eternal Moon" is catchy but weird. The vocals have a pop-punk kind of sound to them. The chorus is a bit silly with these immensely loud keyboards. There's even a funk bass part in the song - now you know what I mean when I say this band sounds confused. Experimenting is OK, but that is a bit too weird for my metallic tastes. "Against My Will" is one of the tracks on the CD that shows that this band came from a much more aggressive past. My theory on the song title is that the singer didn't want to sing on it so he called it "Against My Will" haha...there are more parts in this song that are instrumental then have vocals!! There's a few blast beats on the drums and tremelo picking on the guitar. It's not long-lived but it's a cool element for a band to be able to inject into their sound. I doubt there's many other gothic sounding metal bands that throw that into the mix! This song may even appeal to fans atmospheric black metal. The CD's strongest point is by far the drummer, Igor Dmitriev! This guy manages to bash out some totally killer beats and double kicks that breathe life into some parts that would of otherwise sounded weak. For example the so-so song "Bliss" has a very cool technical sounding guitar/bass thing at about the 3:00 mark. Things like that are found in every song and is what held my attention. The guitar riffs are mostly cool although their are not a lot of leads. <BR><BR>If this was a little less on the gothic/doom/atmospheric sounds I would of liked it a lot more. The band is not without hope (after all I did give it a 3 out of 5). Maybe with stronger vocals and more songs like the CD's two opening tracks they would be set to make some serious waves.  <BR><BR>-----<BR>Взято с www.metal-rules.com<BR>

<BR><BR>Exul / AEBA <BR><BR>"Many Last Episode bands currently have the problem that LE didn't pay <BR>their studio costs. I can only give you some advices to deal with Last <BR>Episode. I think they are going to pay your studio expenditures if you <BR>don't give them the recordings until they haven't paid! (if they still <BR>promote your cd in some magazines then you have very good chances!) Set <BR>them under pressure! Call them as often as you can! (But I think it's <BR>very expensive to call from Russia to Germany) Our studio costs were <BR>paid as our studio threat to erase the recordings and we placed a call <BR>to contact LE on our homepage. This takes nearly a half year! Isn't Karsten<BR>willing to pay your studio costs? This is new for me... Karsten often said<BR>to us that they have paid but they didn't or the cheque was booked back. <BR>As we signed a deal with Last Episode in 1997/98 the situation with LE <BR>was much better but LE always took very long to do something." <BR><BR>V. Orias A. / AD INFERNA (ex-DE PROFUNDIS) <BR><BR>Message 1 <BR><BR>"You touch a real problem my friend. <BR>It takes now 2 months that we have finished the studio at the Excess, and <BR>Karsten has not yet payed the studio bill. So, we should had already <BR>received the master the 15 of August, and at this date (19th of September<BR>2001), no master yet!  I guess it's the same for all the LEP bands, sorry...<BR>I imagine that Karsten is a real problem for all of us." <BR><BR>Message 2 <BR><BR>"Karsten told me one week after the recording session that he will launch<BR>the transfer the same day. Two weeks after, he told me that he has launched<BR>the transfer the previous day. One month after, he said me that he has<BR>already launched it, and finally told that he hasn't transfered any money<BR>because the time. At the moment, he said me that it should had been a<BR>transfer problem... Well, not very convincing... We decided to sign for LEP<BR>because Skaldic Art hadn't got enough money to release our album in time.<BR>Moreover, we were aware that Skaldic Art doesn't have the same promotion<BR>department than LEP, the same for the distribution. In deed, LEP has a very<BR>good promotion dpt with Markus, and some real fucking distributors. It was<BR>always good to have such a deal. But we begin to regret to not have signed<BR>for other interested labels like Candlelight, CCP or again Listenable... We<BR>will see. Moreover, I don't know if you have the same contract than us (3<BR>albums) but it should be really hard to leave out from LEP so far!!!" <BR><BR>Message 3 <BR><BR>KMS: Yeah, Markus is a nice guy. And besides that, yes, I agree at 100%, LEP <BR>perform very good promotional campaigns, and yes, their distribution doesn't<BR>leave anything to be desired... These are the good points. Karsten, however,<BR>is a "bad point"... <BR><BR>"Very bad point, but I guess he changes at the moment he knows that the band<BR>sells well... not before. I don't know if bands like Di'Anno or again <BR>GRAVEWORM has the same troubles with him, I guess not." <BR><BR>KMS: NEVER, NEVER EVER even think of dealing with CCP!!! This company isn't <BR>worth a shit!!!!! Much worse than you could ever imagine... <BR><BR>"Ooh, Ok, I keep it in mind for the future! Anyway, they seemed very <BR>interested in us a few months ago. But anyway, I really think we will stay <BR>at LEP for the future, at least for the first 2 albums..." <BR><BR>KMS: The contract is the same. 3 fucking albums. Actually, I still hope that <BR>LEP will pay us and release CD in time and then... and then we'll try to<BR>find some good reason to break the contract. There're many opportunities to<BR>do it, believe me... F.ex., after all this mess with studio costs, I don't<BR>even hope for getting any royalties - and here we go: you guys don't pay us<BR>royalty, which is in fact a violation of the terms indicated in the<BR>contract, so we demand to stop our collaboration. Makes sense, doesn't it? <BR><BR>"Yes, for you it's make sense, but for Karsten, it's an another story. I <BR>think he knows that it's too hard and too expensive for a band

### Вопрос ко всем, кто ходит на концерты

ixtiandr 20.07.2006 14:52:
А вот немношка зарубежного опыта :)))<BR><BR>DEICIDE<BR><BR>Following the recent events at a Deicide gig in Texas DEICIDE's Ralph<BR>Santolla offers up his own account of the July 14 concert in<BR><BR>Laredo, Texas <BR><BR>DEICIDE's Ralph Santolla offers up his personal statement regarding<BR>the events of July 14 in<BR><BR>Laredo, Texas . DEICIDE are currently preparing for their fall<BR>headlining tour with JUNGLE ROT and HURTLOCKER and are set to release<BR>"The Stench of Redemption" on August 22, which is being called some of<BR>their best work since Legion. Check Earache.com for latest DEICIDE<BR>news and to pre-order "The Stench of Redemption." <BR>His account is as follows: <BR>"We  pulled up a at the hotel in <BR><BR>Laredo around 4 o' clock in the afternoon. One of the local<BR>promoters, Liz, tells us to be downstairs at 6:30 to go to the venue.<BR>After we  sit outside waiting for 45 minutes in the heat, we<BR>decided to go on our own. The first thing I see when we get there is<BR>this Liz chick sitting on her ass in their venue. I  said "Hey<BR>thanks for leaving us sitting around waiting for you to pick us up".<BR>Not a great start. Things were bad from the beginning - there was no<BR>stage and tons of gear everywhere. The promoter said,'We'll set you<BR>guys up after all the other bands, right before you play.' We were<BR>like, that's not how it works, they can set up in front of us. Thats<BR>pretty normal. It took these people an hour to figure out how to move<BR>1/2 a drum set out of our way. A bad start. We asked for 2 hours for<BR>our rider,  but this Liz girl wasn't capable of<BR>giving straight answers to anything and was a lot more concerned with<BR>her local band buddies concerns than putting on a show. We should<BR>never have been booked there in the first place. Right before we go<BR>on stage, they tell us their not paying us what they agreed top in<BR>the contract. A lot of promoters who aren't experienced don't seem to<BR>understand a guarantee means just that, a guarantee. If they risk<BR>their cash to put on a show, and then they don't promote or whatever,<BR>no matter who's fault it is, they take the hit - not the bands. They<BR>never complain when they make a lot of extra cash, but they squeal<BR>like a stuck pig when they don't. This is our career and we were<BR>ripped off - you can't go into Wal Mart and just take whatever you<BR>want without paying. <BR><BR>We go on stage and the power starts cutting out instantly. They<BR>didn't provide a venue, enough power, a stage, the money, or a<BR>working PA. We had to stop every 30 seconds and finally somebody says<BR>they're making us stop, so we go off stage. I went upstairs on the<BR>balcony top find my cigarettes. I'm standing there talking to the<BR>guys from Ringworm, and I turned around and a police officer pepper<BR>sprays me and throws me on the ground. They didn't say "Stop, get on<BR>the ground," nothing - just ran up to me and sprayed me. They threw<BR>me down, and I said "Why am I being arrested" and one of them says, "<BR>you threw a beer bottle at me." I replied, "ME??", and one of the<BR>other cops starts yelling " SHUT THE FU*K UP, SHUT THE FU*K UP, I SAW<BR>YOU I SAW YOU." Then one of them puts his knee into my neck and puts<BR>all of his weight on it and starts grinding my face into the ground.<BR>Now, the thing is, this whole time, I'm just laying there being<BR>still. I can't see, I can't breathe - nothing. So it's not like I was<BR>struggling or resisting. If you've never been pepper sprayed, it<BR>fu*king hurts. Now my hand is all fu*ked up and i've got a loose<BR>tooth. Jack Owen  told me the next day that he saw<BR>somebody in the crowd throw a beer up in the air. It bounced off off<BR>something and hit the ground near the cop and then all the cops went<BR>running up the stairs. That's it. I've done a lot of stupid things,<BR>but throwing bottles at cops isn't one of them." <BR><BR><BR>

There will be a very long change over between Therion and Blind Guardian, so Therion will be on stage earlier. Therion will be the first band.<BR><BR>Update: Therion will also play a heavily reduced set due to the promotor not delivering the stage as agreed. One of the main problems could have been fixed, but Blind Guardian would not allow Therion to use the drum riser. Therion now have to set up the drums in front, leaving only a 1.5m stage left in front of the drums.<BR>The reason for Blind Guardian not allowing Therion to use the drum riser?

Послушал спустя три недели... не вынимается из плэйера ужо пятый день подряд :-))) Вроде бы и слышал все эти песни тысячу раз, но ведь могут же, не стареют душой ветераны !!! ;-)))) Список исполняемых шедевров для интересующихся:<BR>Первый диск<BR>1.E5150/After All (The Dead)<BR>2.The Mob Rules<BR>3.Children of the Sea<BR>4.Lady Evil<BR>5.I<BR>6.The Sign of the Southern Cross<BR>7.Voodoo<BR>8.The Devil Cried<BR><BR>Второй диск<BR>1.Computer God<BR>2.Falling off the Edge of the World<BR>3.Shadow of the Wind<BR>4.Die Young<BR>5.Heaven and Hell<BR>6.Lonely is the Word<BR>7.Neon Knights<BR><BR>Конечно же, жаль, что на диски не вошли отменные песни "Master of Insanity" и "TV Crimes", ну так, видимо, у дяденек Dio - Iommi - Geezer - Appice были свои соображения на этот счёт.

Клавишник только нервно в сторонке стоял... и замечал, что иногда нажимал на клавиши, когда от клавиш вообще никаких звуков не было. Антураж...<BR>Хотя и партии его носят больше характер звукового дизайна.. Недаром они клавишникам очень благодарны - лишнего не играют, музыки фактически никакой не делают... Но и получают так неплохо...<BR> <BR>Из самых любимых вещей услышал только Falling to the edge of the world. А так очень хотелось бы услышать ещё Voodoo, Sign of the southern cross, Over and over и три вещи с Dehumanizer - After All, Letters From Earth и Master Of Insanity. ну и как контрастную, быструю и угарную можно было бы TV Crimes с сюрноватым видеорядом на эту тему... В этих вещах, мне кажется, музыки побольше... А так, всё что исполнили - какое-то не иначе как усреднённое. Да, классные вещи, но с вышеперечисленными была бы изюминка.. (правда Дио говорит, что слишком уж он для него кровождные). Единственное, что удерживает от того, чтобы огорчаться, так это то, что они старики, уровень притязаний уже не тот (чего только стоит тот факт, что они послушались оззикову жену и отказались от того, чтобы Black Sabbath называться) и хорошо, что хватило пороху ещё записать новые вещи.

Are you part of a band for the right reasons? And do you really want this? What are your thoughts on the aspect of being away from home over shorter and longer periods of time performing for your fans? Are you aware of the sacrifice you have to still do after all these years to be able to continue this and are you aware of the workload and the sacrifice not only the other members have done and still do, but also people working with the band in other areas have done over the years, while you haven?t? You need to do your part, or at least do an attempt to be given a fair chance of survival, even if it?s not as much. Certain simple basic things, which are spawned out of common sense, those are the things we expect from you. That?s if you want to be looked at as a member of a music group and be taken seriously. The things mentioned above are all obvious factors and basic principles you need to be square on and aware about; if not, you?re wasting yours and other people?s valuable time. <BR><BR>Further down is a couple of things Vortex and Mustis simply ?forgot? to mention in their previous statements respectively. Also the fact that Mustis? statement(s) not being written by himself but by someone else means it is false accusations and have been registered as such by our lawyers. <BR><BR>Lesson number one, the obvious one: Don?t forget to bring your instrument when you?re about to play a festival in which you?re going to perform in front of thousands of fans that have travelled far and paid money to see you play. Maybe you haven?t been into it so much the last couple of years and it?s - on top of that - an early flight; you feel things are a bit tedious ? no worries, we all experience this from time to time but we know the deal by now after so long, and so many years. Or, so we thought. <BR><BR>But, we shouldn?t have to remind you to bring your own instrument to a gig. For that there?s no excuse, neither will we accept one.<BR><BR>Lesson number two, a less obvious one and can easily be forgotten while under the influence but still: Don?t hurt yourself in an alcoholic rage smashing a glass to your forehead putting yourself, your band ?mates?, crew, not to mention the show(s), in jeopardy. Remember, the money you care so much about getting, compared to the minimal of effort you put in won?t be paid out to you or anyone else in the band if the show(s) doesn?t happen. You have responsibility. We suspect this weren?t part of your calculation, obviously none of us are perfect but as a grown up person, we expect more.<BR><BR>Luckily for you, the make up covers the cut from the smashed glass on your forehead onstage. You did manage to get away with general bullshit, classical cocky rock star attitude and carelessness ? this time too. You wouldn?t get away with it at home around your family so what makes you think it?s fine to behave like an asshole around your band members, your family away from home? On-stage equals posing, off-stage it?s a no-no.<BR>But, contrary to other times in the past, there simply won?t be another chance and you know so goddamn well why you?re not given yet another. Suddenly, we?re the bad guys because you expected another shot out of mere habit, just because we were too nice in the past to grant you another one and another one. Your stage sound and set-up we won?t bother to address anymore. Your stage performance lately we won?t bother to mention either. You know why you?re not part of this band anymore, don?t make excuses and make it look like it?s someone else?s fault when you very well know it was you alone who put you where you are right now.<BR>

Now, auctioning off your band?s most recent album on eBay, only signed by yourself, can?t be looked upon in any other ways as pure greed, not to mention mockery, towards the rest of the members of the band that you?re still in, AND the fans. Attempting to sell a CD of the last album (which you can still get hold of in shops) with only your signature on it for the highest bid is a remarkably low act. <BR><BR>Instead of getting hold of some work to do, if money is what you so desperately seem to be needing (while you actually maybe rather should be considering working on ideas for a new album if you?re so concerned about being credited correctly), you rather believe the easiest and fastest way to money must simply be to start a blackmailing procedure against the other members in the band holding important files as ransom - files that are the band?s property which we need for future projects that would bring you money later eventually, in one way or another. Now it won?t. Not a very smart and thought out thing to do. Not to mention the fans now have to wait for these special releases because your ego for some odd reason is hurt and in total control.<BR><BR>These files, which we handed over to you in good trust over a year ago as a band member and what we?d consider a brother despite your lazy ass, not surprisingly you haven?t even touched it as part as bonus features special of a re-release campaign including certain albums. <BR><BR>Instead, you threaten to sue your fellow band members for neglect and not treating you right monetary wise. Isn?t it typical? You both want to harvest the fruits, but putting labour into it yourself is not so important. See how long that?ll last in real life. Ironically, it lasted this long with the band, finally now that time is over.<BR><BR>This shouldn?t be acceptable. So what do we do? We don?t accept it. After all these years wiping people?s asses and feeding their mouths, we?re forced to take on another strict angle, like you do with kids when nothing else works. To be forced to almost constantly spend energy on dragging someone to practice for instance and be part of a unit ? a force, is tedious for the rest of us. Always an excuse not to do what?s expected of you.<BR><BR>To the best of our efforts, we?ve tried to explain over and over, again and again how the business side of things work, but when ignorance is bliss and the people it concerns fail to even meet at band business meetings, later not understanding and realizing because of the obvious fact that they weren?t present, the deal is then suddenly we?re ?hiding something? and ?I must get ripped off, there?s no other logical explanation!?<BR><BR>Sounds familiar to some of you readers?<BR><BR>But on the contrary, we?ve not been afraid of encouraging the use and exploration of talents of other members elsewhere while still being in the band. We have even handed over major projects on a silver plate but to not even bother replying to such offers speaks volumes. We can?t do that job for you too. What about the talk of a certain ?solo? project for the last 10 years? Where is it? Talk, that?s what it is. Talk and no action.<BR><BR>Still complaining, not trusting your partners for the last 10 years when receiving a pay check, worth way beyond your song ?writing? ability and what you?re already credited for is fair in your eyes. It?s amusing and at the same time sad to see how little reflective and humble grown people can be sometimes; or in this particular case, most of the time.<BR><BR>Stop acting like composers and song writers until you have written and released something on your own that?s worthwhile and we?ll see how well you do. To quote Vortex in his very own statement; ?I have really enjoyed the ride!? Sure you have, it?s been for free! Either because of lack of interest, dedication, understanding and capability or all of those.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
