### 01.12.2002 reviews Controversial and entertaining

<p>A matter of taste, so to say… I mean, I _love_ this kind of music (do I hear someone asking if I'm serious about considering THIS a music? Well, I am) and there's no way to make me think different. TOTAL DUNKELHEIT is a young Swedish three-piece delivering harsh power noise the best way possible. The CD comes with eight tracks of pure sonic disaster (ha, they even have a song entitled “Kursk” here! Cute.) + … a cover from VENOM. “In League With Satan”, to be exact. So how do you like it, huh? Have you ever heard a metal song covered by some noise / industrial combo? No? Well, now you have such a possibility. Quite controversial, yet entertaining. AT LEAST entertaining. Generally speaking, this CD is definitely worth listening to… although first find out what 'power noise' really is. If you're a diehard fan of metal music, acquaintance with TOTAL DUNKELHEIT might be a worst kind of surprise. But if you're open to all kinds of music, even those kinds the narrow-minded ones usually refuse to name 'music' at all, act fast – the CD is limited to 100 copies.</p>
