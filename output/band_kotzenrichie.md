### 13.03.2001 news WAR &amp; PEACE - Tunnel Vision!

<p>DOKKEN bassist Jeff Pilson, who fronted his own band, WAR & PEACE, in the late '80s, is revisiting that band again with a new album, Light At The End Of The Tunnel, due out in late April/May. The material consists of some songs intended for but not used by Dokken, songs Pilson had never finished, and others he did that appeared elsewhere. Pilson, who sings and plays all the basic tracks on it, gets assistance from SCORPIONS drummer James Kottak on all but two of the ten songs, and from a lineup of solo-contributing guitarists. Reb Beach plays on two tracks, John Norum plays on one as does Paul Gilbert, who recorded his performance in Japan and air expressed it to Pilson. Gilbert's MR. BIG replacement Richie Kotzen plays on two cuts, and Jon Levin, the WARLOCK guitarist-turned-lawyer who actually did one fill-in date with Dokken, is also heard on one track. Pilson himself contributes the solo to 'Playing God Again'. "Best solo I've ever done," he says proudly.</p>
