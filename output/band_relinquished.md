One of the most important new features is the addition of the outstanding vocal talent of Vintersorg (from the Swedish band of the same name) and Otyg. When ICS Vortex relinquished ties to the band to concentrate on his duties with Dimmu Borgir, the search began for his replacement which luckily did not take long. With a friendship spanning several years, Шystein and Vintersorg realized the commonalities in their musical attitudes and motivations, so it became natural for these friends to work together. Bassist Tyr (Emperor, Satyricon) contributes yet another unique dimension to Empiricism's sound, while Lars A. Nedland continues to diligently split his creativisms between SOLEFALD and BORKNAGAR.<BR><BR>Splitting their time in Fagerborg Studios and producer Bшrge Finstad's very own Toproom Studio in Norway allowed the members of BORKNAGAR to experiment with orchestrations on a Hammond organ, on grand pianos and string sections. The fast and furious "The Genuine Pulse" and the beauty and dark passion of songs like "Gods of My World" and "Inherit The Earth" will leave no doubts of the unprecedented quality of this epic album.<BR><BR>The new line-up is: Шystein G. Brun on guitar, Vintersorg on vocals, Tyr on bass, Lars A. Nedland on synthesizers, Asgeir Mickelson on drums, and Jens F. Ryland on guitar.<BR><BR>Empiricism's track-listing is as follows: The Genuine Pulse, Gods Of My World, The Black Canvas, Matter & Motion, Soul Sphere, Inherit The Earth, The Stellar Dome, Four Element Synchronicity, Liberated, The View of Everlast for a total running time of 50:08.<BR><BR>На официальном сайте (<A HREF="<A HREF="http://www.borknagar.com)"" target="_blank">http://www.borknagar.com)"</A> target="_blank"><A HREF="http://www.borknagar.com)</A>" target="_blank">http://www.borknagar.com)</A></A> можно также послушать одну из песен нового альбома - The Genuine Pulse. Мне понравилось, напомнило времена "Odemarkens Son"...
