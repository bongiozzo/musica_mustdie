hello. i'm from the states. i'm very interested in the russian scene and have been to this site many times.<BR><BR>content: great list of bands. nice use of genres. more info would be nice...that will come, though. i would like to see where a band is from, more often.<BR><BR>russian bands: it's dificult for non russian speakers to research the russian scene. (especially the history.)   from what i've heard so far, i like Exhumer, Absurd and Legion the best. i've heard more that i like, but can't think of the names as i'm very drunk at the time.<BR><BR>also, i love what i've heard from Heresiarh.  Lead Weight seems cool, too<BR><BR>i hope you don't mind if i ask some questions.
