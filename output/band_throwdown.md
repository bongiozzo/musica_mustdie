С оф сайта:<BR>OFFICIAL STATEMENT<BR><BR><BR>SOILWORK, who recently completed the Lamb Of God/Killswitch Engage U.S. tour in support of their new album Sworn To A Great Divide, have decided to part ways with guitarist Ola Frenning.<BR><BR>It was felt that Ola resisted the demands of the road and found it difficult to come to terms with the amount of touring scheduled.<BR><BR>Sworn To A Great Divide is SOILWORK's fastest seller and the live demand for the band is growing. They intend to play everywhere and fulfill the album's potential.<BR><BR>Vocalist Bjцrn "Speed" Strid says: 'It was a very difficult decision to make because Ola has been our friend and bandmate for a very long time'.<BR><BR>The decision will not affect any of SOILWORK's plans. Guitarist David Andersson will fill in on their upcoming Finnish/Baltic tour as well as the "Scum Of The Earth" U.S. tour with Throwdown. The band will then tour Australia, Japan and South-East Asia before returning to Europe for festivals and a headlining U.S. tour in the Fall.<BR><BR><BR>Ola Frenning comments: 'After 10 years, 7 albums and several world wide tours, we've realised that we have developed in different directions and have a different set of values, profession wise. The disagreements have reached their peak and it has become an untenable situation. The band's solution is that I part ways with them so that I won't be in the way for the future plans of SOILWORK.<BR><BR>However, since I'm not gonna be on the road (at least for a while), I will now be able to continue with my songwriting and producing at another level. For further information, visit www.myspace.com/olafrenning. The page will be updated in the near future.<BR><BR>Cheers to ya all... And thanks for making these 10 years with the band memorable'.<BR><BR>-Ola Frenning<BR><BR>posted by: Soilwork (12 Feb 2008)<BR><BR><BR>НА сколько я понимаю к нам группа приедет с новым гитаристом. ???<BR><BR>
