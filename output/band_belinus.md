### 20.11.2002 reviews Best song off this effort sounds pretty much similar to PRIMORDIAL’s worst

<p>Too many Irish this time, don’t you think? No? Well, I’ve just reviewed CRUACHAN’s “Folk-Lore” and MOURNING BELOVETH’s “Dust”, currently review BELINUS’ debut (?) offering, and have “In Unison” giant 2-CD compilation in store for tomorrow. Sometimes it’s just too much. I would love to go to Ireland one day, I do have respect for the distinctiveness it’s scene is know for, however… sometimes it simply doesn’t work. Like in case with BELINUS, for instance. This MCD – well packaged, although I doubt if compiling exactly this color of scripts and exactly this background in the inlay was the right choice – comes with five songs of typically (sic!) Irish pagan / black metal. Sadly enough, the best song off this effort sounds pretty much similar to PRIMORDIAL’s worst. “Battlechants” is too noisy, it lacks complexity… Too many drums in the mix (as well as too rough mix in general)… and absolutely unmemorable tunes also drop down few points. It’s definitely not as bad as you might have thought after reading this review… it’s just absolutely nothing special. If you get high on bands like PRIMORDIAL, “Battlechants” may be of interest to you anyway…</p>
