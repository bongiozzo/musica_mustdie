<p>All In Vain formed in 1997 by some members of Lost Child, a thrash metal band fairly famous in nord Italy. The new band decided to play a swedish death metal which unites melody and power with influences from In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Edge Of Sanity, At The Gates, but not renouncing the thrash metal roots. After a good year of live acts arrived the first demotape which received good reviews all over Italy (a track appeared on Psychosonic cd n° 18). In the year 2000 there was a change in the line-up and the new band began to write the new songs. <BR><BR> In november 2001 was out the new promocd “The Backside Of Humanity”, co-produced with the metal shop Marrakesh Music of Modena.<BR><BR> With this new cd All In Vain reconfirm the leadership in the death metal scenery of Modena.
