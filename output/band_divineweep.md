### 16.07.2016 news Worldwide release of the second full-length album by Polish Heavy&#x2F;Power Metal band DIVINE WEEP 

<p>Official worldwide release of the second full-length album by Polish Heavy/Power Metal band DIVINE WEEP "Tears Of Ages" via Metal Scrap. Released in January 2016 by Stormspell Records for US market only, now "Tears Of The Ages" is available for the whole world. Recorded from March until September 2015, the album consists of 10 tracks in classic Heavy/Power Metal style. Drums were recorded in the renowned Hertz Studio, which works with world's leading Metal bands (Vader, Behemoth, Decapitated), while guitars, bass and vocals were recorded in Dobra 12 Studio, supervised by Piotr Polak. The album was mixed and mastered in Hertz Studio as well.</p><p>An interesting bit is definitely the guest appearance of Wojciech Hoffmann from the band Turbo on the title track. The musician, an icon of Polish Rock and Metal scene, played an exceptional solo, which certainly gives the song an additional bite.<br>"Tears Of The Ages" it's 50 minutes of real Metal music comprising tradition and modernity. Strong but melodic riffs along the lines of the genre classics like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Judas Priest. The sound is modern, powerful and elaborate, carrying the echoes of the pioneers' heirs, such as Primal Fear. Each piece is complemented by a number of juicy solos, and high-pitched melodic vocals are a flagship of this material. If we add fantasy themed and existential lyrics, then we receive a full picture of a varied, feisty and ambitious album!</p><p>This is a great album with rapid fire drums and shredding guitar solos that leaves you wanting more!!</p><p>Highly recommended for fans of: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Primal Fear and Helloween!!!</p><p><center><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1500754820/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" style="border: 0px currentColor; width: 60%; height: 120px;" seamless="">&amp;amp;lt;a href="http://metalscraprecords.bandcamp.com/album/divine-weep-tears-of-the-ages"&amp;amp;gt;DIVINE WEEP &amp;amp;amp;quot;Tears Of The Ages&amp;amp;amp;quot; by Metal Scrap Records&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;</iframe><p></p></center>
