Вот Ассошиэйтед Пресс:<BR><BR> COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ A gunman charged onstage at a nightclub and opened fire on the band and crowd, killing top heavy metal guitarist ``Dimebag'' Darrell Abbott and three other people before a police officer shot him to death, authorities said.<BR>    The gunman had a hostage in a headlock and appeared to be preparing to kill him when the officer hit him in the face with a rifle, a witness and police spokesman Sgt. Brent Mull said. The hostage escaped uninjured, Mull said.<BR>    Two other people were hospitalized. Police said one was in intensive care and the other was stable.<BR>    Police identified the gunman as Nathan Gale, 25, of Marysville, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Columbus. Police said they had no information on a motive or any connection to Abbott or his band, the Texas-based group Damageplan.<BR>    Damageplan had just begun its first song at Alrosa Villa club Wednesday night when the gunman climbed onstage, started yelling and shot Abbott five or six times at point-blank range, witness Chris Couch said.<BR>    Mull said the gunman's exact statement was unclear because of the loud music. He said some witnesses reported hearing an accusation about Abbott breaking up his former band, thrash-rock pioneer Pantera, but police could not confirm whether the speaker was the gunman or a fan.<BR>    Police believe there were earlier threats against the band, Mull said. He declined to give specifics.<BR>    Witnesses said the man, who was wearing a Columbus Blue Jackets hockey jersey over a hooded sweat shirt, jumped an 2.5-meter (8-foot) wooden fence and was being followed through the crowd by club security.<BR>    After firing on the guitarist, the gunman shot a bouncer who had pulled him off the musician, while fans surged toward the exit, said Couch, 22. The gunman then fired into the crowd of more than 250 people, Mull said.

Mull said Officer James D. Niggemeyer, patrolling nearby, arrived within two minutes of hearing the call. Niggemeyer, 31, saw one person lying dead and the suspect holding onto another ``pretty much in a headlock,'' Mull said.<BR>    He said the hostage was able to maneuver out of the way before the officer fired.<BR>    ``If the officer wasn't as close as he was, I think this would have been a lot worse,'' he said. ``It was a chaotic scene, just a horrific scene.''<BR>    Besides Abbott and Gale, police identified the dead as Nathan Bray, 23; Erin Halk, 29, and Jeff Thompson, 40.<BR>    Couch said he believed the shooter had a plan. ``It was definitely a grudge. It was against something,'' he said.<BR>    Mull said he believed there was amateur video that officers could view for clues but that police had no answers yet. ``We may never know a motive for this, unless he left a note,'' Mull said.<BR>    Gale has a minor police record in Marysville, said Police Chief Floyd Golden. He was pulled over for driving with a suspended license last month.<BR>    The tall, physically imposing Gale hung out at Bears Den Tattoo Studio, staring at people and trying to get them to talk about music and bands, manager Lucas Bender said.<BR>    ``He's not wanted,'' Bender said. ``The most pointless conversations.''<BR>    Dozens of messages were posted to the band's Web site after the shootings. ``This is the worst day in metal history,'' one posting read.<BR>    Damageplan's debut album, ``New Found Power,'' which was released in February by Elektra, was produced by Abbott and his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott. Other band members are vocalist Patrick Lachman and bassist Bob Zilla.<BR>    Earlier, the brothers had been members of the Grammy-nominated Pantera, whose popularity soared in the early 1990s with a fast, aggressive sound.<BR>    ``Damageplan carries on the tradition Pantera started, the ... hell-raising tradition we were all about,'' Vinnie Paul Abbott told The Dallas Morning News in October.<BR>    ``It took awhile for some of the Pantera fans to accept it; we knew that was gonna be the case,'' he said. ``Change is something that people have a hard time accepting. But me and Dime intended on doing this our whole lives.''<BR>    The shootings came exactly 24 years after John Lennon was shot to death outside his New York apartment building by a deranged fan.

"The Dallas Morning News is reporting that the Columbus police are trying to determine whether Nathan Gale, a 25-year-old semipro football player accused of killing DAMAGEPLAN guitarist "Dimebag" Darrell Abbott, was incensed because of last year's breakup of Mr. Abbott's previous band, PANTERA, one of the top metal acts of the 1990s. <BR><BR>"He loved PANTERA. He was like weird, man, about his obsession with PANTERA," said Mike Norris, who frequents a tattoo parlor across the street from Mr. Gale's home in Marysville, a town about 25 miles from Columbus. "I knew the guy was out to lunch, but I can't believe this." <BR><BR>Mr. Gale, a landscaper, mechanic and sometimes bass player who had just made his car payment a day earlier, ran along the stage Wednesday night and yelled something before firing five or six times at Mr. Abbott, 38, from point-blank range. <BR><BR>Abbott died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head, according to the Franklin County coroner's office.<BR><BR>The 6-foot-3, 266-pound gunman had a man in a headlock and appeared to be reloading when the officer shot him in the face with a rifle, a police spokesman said. <BR><BR>The hostage was unharmed, but Jeff Thompson of Dallas, 40, a technician with the band, was killed, as were Erin Halk, 29, a club employee, and fan Nathan Bray, 23. Two others were injured, one critically. <BR><BR>Other victims of Nathan Gale at the Alrosa Villa club Wednesday night: <BR><BR>Jeff Thompson (photo), 40, Dallas.
