You know,|I don't know you and you don't know me...<BR>... so I guess, outside is best for me.<BR>Here I go.<BR>Good night.<BR>I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside.<BR>Sit by myself outside, I guess.<BR>I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.<BR>-I thought, I told you to stay outside.|-I am outside.<BR>Well James.

Sing with me Shrek!|I'm on road again...<BR>What did I say about singing?<BR>-Can I whistle?|-No.<BR>-Well, can I hummer?| -All right.<BR>That's enough.
