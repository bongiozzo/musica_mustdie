### 03.12.2002 news L&#x2F;P Ink Deal With SPITFIRE RECORDS

<p>L/P, the new group featuring former DOKKEN members George Lynch (guitar) and Jeff Pilson (bass/vocals), are about to sign a domestic deal with Spitfire Records and "we're over-the-top excited about it," Pilson wrote on his official web site. "A final release date has yet to be named, but my guess is March or April, shouldn't be any later than that. The label has been so supportive of the music and direction, and that was pretty much what made us go with them. I'm going to be working hard with them to try and incorporate as much of the Internet fan base as we can, so all of you can be active participants in the record campaign if you choose. We'd like to organize street teams, etc. in the hopes that more people will hear this than the usual release. It's funny how a lot of new heavy bands are starting to acknowledge us [DOKKEN, George, etc.] as influences, so maybe a new audience will appreciate what we do. I would be very happy if the record is made aware to anyone who will listen and they have an opportunity to judge it on its own merits. This could be an exciting year for us, and I'm hoping that everyone here can be an integral part of it. For those of you wanting to join in, get ready to start writing a lot of e-mails!" <BR><BR> In the same update on his web site, Pilson also once again addressed his decision to file a lawsuit against two of his ex-bandmates, singer/guitarist Don Dokken and drummer Mick Brown, to dissolve their musical and financial partnership.<BR><BR> "[The lawsuit] was never really intended to be a public issue, but apparently the rock press has a system for discovering any lawsuits filed which involve people in their data base," he said. "This suit is strictly a business matter, which I've been left no choice but to pursue. However this in no way affects what DOKKEN was, or what any of us have ever contributed to it. Someone on the message board posted something about how maybe we all should never have met, and it made him or her sick! I gotta say, I can relate to that! If I were to read about this kind of thing, I'd probably say, 'how pathetic!' And you know what, it IS pathetic, and unfortunate. But I will never say that I wish we were never to have become a band. Even amongst the dreadful string of memories, I still remain extremely proud of the work we did and the music we made. It is time to move on, however, and I think everyone involved owes the franchise DOKKEN a great deal of respect, and we'll all have to trust that the outcome will be positive for all parties. I'm sure it will, and I'd like nothing more than for everyone to get a clean start and their fair share of opportunities. I trust it will all be good in the end."</p>
