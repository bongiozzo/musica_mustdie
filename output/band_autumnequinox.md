<p>Februari 2000: the birth of a musical experience took place. Michael Leeninga, Ruud van Diepen, Boudewijn van Nooijen and Johan de Graaff decided to combine their musical capacities and created the progressive metalband Autumn Equinox. Autumn Equinox is a astrological fenomenon in which, just like the Spring Equinox night and day are equal. With a quite broad musical background the bandmembers create progressive, symphonic and technical metal with many elements from other musical genres.</p>
<p>April 2000: Keyboardplayer Sebastiaan Koenen joined Autumn Equinox. Because of his classical and jazz background his entry resulted in an even more complex and dynamic sound. Unfortunately, vocalist Johan de Graaff decided to leave Autumn Equinox, due to personal matters. Autumn Equinox now was forced to give only instrumental concerts. Autumn Equinox strives for making a progressive and powerfull sound without any musical restrictions. The many rythm-changes and melodie-turns make Autumn Equinox's music dynamic and exciting.</p>
<p>June 2001: Maureen Bakker, known from dutch metalband Dastard, joins the band. With her, a long time of instrumental performances came to an end. However, begin 2002, Maureen and Boudewijn leave AE. The search for new members doesn't take long, cause after a few weeks a new bass-player is found: Kees Harrison. Kees, also active in dutch deathmetalband Necrology, has an incredible virtuosity and musical ideas which suits the progressive melodies of AE.</p>
