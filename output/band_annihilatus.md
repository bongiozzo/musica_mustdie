### 04.11.2002 reviews &#39;Finnish destruktion metal&#39;? There’s definitely no better definition.

<p>If I told you this is going to be Finland’s black metal, what would you think of? MOONSORROW, KALMAH, FINNTROLL? Nah. Wrong. “Blood And War” doesn’t have anything to do with these Spinefarm’s cute little babes. Perhaps, THYRANE? Wrong again. This one’s _too_ raw and ugly. As _raw_ and _ugly_ that it makes you start considering THYRANE a love metal band. Even though Serpent (vocals, guitars) claims he “never was into BEHERIT musically”, I guess BEHERIT is THE band whose works (apparently, early ones) can (should?) be compared to. Surprisingly enough, recorded in two days of January 2002 this work was made available shortly thereafter, and all eight studio tracks remind me of no one but BEHERIT… well, and ANNIHILATUS as well. They’re slowly elaborating a style – or should I say, sound? – of their own, and it seems like this quartet is quite successful at that. Raw and ugly? Well, epithets like ‘harsh’ and ‘grim’ might be added as well. Centurion doesn’t scream, doesn’t snarl, doesn’t screech, doesn’t shriek. He SPITS. And believe me, finding out who else’s capable of delivering equally hateful vocals isn’t that easy. “Blood And War” also features three more tracks, two of them live, whilst the closing one, “Apokalypse”… well, I don’t know where it’s been recorded, but it really seems like it came out from “behind the enemy lines” – just as the inlay states. ‘Finnish destruktion metal’? There’s definitely no better definition. I bet.</p>
