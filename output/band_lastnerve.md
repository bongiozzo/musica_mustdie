### 26.08.2003 bios Last Nerve Bio

<p>Last Nerve was formed in the winter of 1994/1995 in Tri-Cities, WA. and began building a foundation that would launch one of the area’s heaviest bands. The band was constantly evolving musically from the inception of the band, to the music that makes Last Nerve what it is today. Their first CD release, 1999’s “Same Difference”, shows the band paying heavy debt to the bands that were their main inspirations. Heavily in the Pantera/Megadeth vein, “Same Difference” is just a precursor of things to come. Now with their 2002 sophomore release "Chemical Drive" the band shows their true musicianship and song writing abilities. The band’s crushing guitar riffage hopes to make heavy music in vogue again, a trend that all but disappeared with the popularity of alternative and grunge rock. With the release of “Chemical Drive” they hope to set the world on its collective ear. Last Nerve hopes to claim their rightful place among the amazingly talented list of heavy music bands.</p>
