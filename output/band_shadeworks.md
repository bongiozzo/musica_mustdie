### 17.11.2002 reviews &#39;Harmonic&#39; is the word

<p>‘Harmonic’ is the word. “Sooty Limbs” (surprisingly a self-released effort) comes with four tracks. Four tracks of music which, in the first turn, is _harmonic_. Based on tender, nearly charming guitar passages and a duet of tranquil male / tremendously sorrowful female voices, “Sooty Limbs” is fascinating… hypnotic… mesmerizing. Atmospherically celestial, so to say. I believe, it would better accompany a forlorn soul than two of flesh and blood… making love, for instance. “Sooty Limbs” can’t be easily defined. Each of us will perceive it according to his / her inner world – or inner sanctum, if you like that better. No more empty words, no senseless descriptions. Enter the world different to yours…</p>
