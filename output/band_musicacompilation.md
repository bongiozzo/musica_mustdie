### 12.11.2001 reviews Hey, what&#39;s the big deal with this comp, huh??

<p>Hey, what's the big deal with this comp, huh?? Well, it's definitely a big deal itself, and you'd better remember that. "Musica" probably is the first more or less pro-done compilation featuring bands exclusively of Russian origin, therefore purchasing it might be a good chance to figure out what's Russian metal scene alike, who deserves your support and who doesn't. Ok, closer to the subject: this CD starts with an instrumental track by GLAZEMAKER, which is absolutely of no interest. SEDUCER'S EMBRACE _are_ of interest, though. Even though I know the guys personally for a pretty long time, I haven't ever heard what they stand for, musically. Well, now I have Ѓг and it was rather enjoyable experience, by the way. In short, "As The Forest Weeps" strikes as a cross between melodic black and death metal, one of the best I've ever got myself acquainted with, at least when it comes to Russian combos. Next we have SAMHAIN, which, in terms of perception, are closer to GLAZEMAKER than SEDUCER'S EMBRACE. Got the point? WISHMASTER„Ј Oh, holy shit! Fast-paced pseudo-melodic pseudo-black metal with a wretchedly programmed drummachine, badly out of key„Ј Horrible. LEAD WEIGHT are a step above, but only a step. This pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-death metal left me cold, although "For Thine Is The Kingdome" is of course not as disgusting as "Betrayer" by the band discussed few lines above. RADIGOST? Hmm, once I considered 'em one of the best (if not the best) sympho-black metal act in Russia„Ј now I don't. If their second work is comprised of tracks like this, it will be no less than worthless. Plastic CoF imitation with plastic guitars, plastic vocals, plastic keyboards and plastic drummachine. They have a nice-looking website, though. HOSTILE BREED? Better check out the review on "GreenWound", the latest CD of theirs. What's next? Ah, regular black / death metal by EXHUMATION. Ok, it's not utterly bad, nor it is highly impressive. Just mediocre. With VORTEX we finally have a little jewel: stunning power metal featuring (what a surprise!) a singer possessing a good-sounding voice. Nevertheless, these chaps have to work more on arrangements. REQUIEM? Doom-metal-smth. ELISIUM? Goth-pop-smth. TVANGESTE? Sympho-black-metal-smth. Who would be the 13th? Obviously, a black metal act Ѓг and here comes ROSSOMAHAAR with a song off the second CD due for release this Winter. I guess, it's needless to say anything regarding this band Ѓг they should be listened to. What I can't but mark out though, is the sound execution: the best one on "Musica". ABSURD occupied the 14th track with "Where Time Has Died Away" off "Beyond The Dawn" demo. Top-notch death / black metal the Swedish way. "Sarjaylau" by Jamilya Serkebaeva & FORREST GUMP end this compilation with a excellently brutal and simultaneously charming folk piece. All in all, "Musica" perfectly reflects the crisis Russia's metal scene currently endures. Lotsa bands, but only six of them doubtlessly good ones (SEDUCER'S EMBRACE, HOSTILE BREED, VORTEX, ROSSOMAHAAR, ABSURD and Jamilya Serkebaeva / FORREST GUMP).</p>

MUSICA COMPILATION<BR>This is a a compilation done by great russian label Musica Mustdie and it features fifteen excellent russian bands full of power and interesting ideas. This is a showcase of arrangements, dark ideas and amazing melodies that go through styles as different as black metal, death metal and gothic. The bands here are really different one from each other, going from the full of keyboards attack of Glazemaker to the melodic death metal of Seducerґs Embrace to the more death/black operistic sounds of Samhain. Here we have a broad range of musical ideas and you can feel how good the russian scene is developing achieveing new ideas with this bands. Here is a must for any lover of metal music that wants something new and wants to dive deep into the russian scene. <BR><BR>LEAD WEIGHT<BR>Here we have a technical death metal band full of riffs, tempo changes and extremely aggressive music. Here we have a band that plays complicated music intertwining clean guitars with the most extreme guitar riffs and mixing everything really well. There are plenty of complex and twisted melodies that make the music even more interesting. The vocals are really extreme and contrast heavily with some of the riffs and melodies. The sound is good and raw and the guitars can be listened perfectly while doing their combination of rhythm and melody. There are two types of vocals that fit each one in some part of the compositions changing the mood of the songs really well. There are some neoclassical leads within the death metal context that sound really original and there are also some thrash metal influences. This is a really good band that you donґt have to miss.<BR><BR>SEDUCER"S EMBRACE<BR>A climatic acoustic introduction with keyboards leads us into the amazing world of Seducerґs Embrace music. The music here is a combination of death metal with many elements that make the band original such as the melodies that create the guitars and that are everywhere on this recording. Some of the riffs are really intrincate and complex and they need really good musicianship to be played as well as this band does. The great thing here is the combination of the amazing guitar riffs with all the melodies and the brutal vocals. There is a great mix of fast parts and sloweer more rhythmic ones. This is a great band from the Russian underground that deserves to be in the top scene because of their quality. You can purchase or trade this CD from Musica Prods.<BR>

ЛОООЛ<BR><BR>"Here we have a technical death metal band full of riffs..." - пхраза года, однозначно! Дэт-металл, наполненный риффами. Вот неожиданность!<BR><BR>"The sound is good and raw and the guitars can be listened perfectly while doing their combination of rhythm and melody." - Тоже неплохо. Гитары, создающие комбинацию из ритма и мелодии!<BR><BR>"... music here is a combination of death metal with many elements that make the band original such as the melodies that create the guitars and that are everywhere on this recording." Это я вообще не понял, бред какой-то:)<BR><BR>Сильные рецензии:) Грамотные и содержательные:)

мда, не верится, что это писал человек, что-то понимающий в тяжелой музыке.

Мне больше всего понравилось вот это:<BR><BR>"Some of the riffs are really intrincate and complex and they need really good musicianship to be played"<BR><BR>Седюсеры теперь техно-дэт заиграли!

AndyVortex / ARIDA VORTEX 25.03.2003 12:59:
Вот что, кстати, пришло в голову - возможно это только в совке принято опускать и обсирать металлические группы, а буржуйкие металхэды предпочитают такие банды холить и лелеять, чтоб совсем без них не остаться?...<BR>

2 AliFeSin<BR><BR>... music here is a combination of death metal with many elements that make the band original such as the melodies that create the guitars and that are everywhere on this recording.<BR><BR>.... Музыка здесь это комбинация смерти металла с многими элементами которые делают группу оригинальной такой как мелодии которые создают гитары и что везде на этой записи<BR><BR>И чего тут непонятного? 

ixtiandr 25.03.2003 13:53:
ЭндиВортекс: хуйъ там, у них тоже хватает негативных отчетов. Просто это какой-то долбойоп напесал, который видимо до этого ваще нихуйа не слышал :wacko:
