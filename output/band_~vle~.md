### 04.06.2003 reviews There&#39;s no other such band in the whole godforsaken Universe

<p>I still can't figure out whether I should take these CD's for "official" ones... or demo's? Well, be them album's or demo's, these "chapters" strike as pretty much exciting. Speaking about music, of course. Since vocals are few in number... very few, if you get what I mean. No, VLE isn't another WINDHAM HELL, although approach is more or less similar. 99% instrumental music based on dark ambient-like soundscapes and a bit (only a bit!) of black metal. Whilst "Chapter II" is more of a serene, tranquil canvas to listen to and relax (or perhaps meditate?), "Chapter III" a) is twice as longer, b) features crusty guitars and those BM reminiscences I seemed to mention about few lines above. Well, both are definitely worth a listen. At least, VLE is VLE. There's no other such band in the whole godforsaken Universe.<BR> "... all works were created through use of experimentation and improvisational techniques: the most important element is the depiction of atmosphere where all instruments / sounds fuse together. Noise, chaos, infinity, beauty, darkness, light, pain, harmony, melancholy, rhythm, power, melody, repetition, dissonance and duality are all concepts expressed herein..."</p>
