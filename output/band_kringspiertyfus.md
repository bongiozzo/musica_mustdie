### 01.06.2003 bios Biography Kringspiertyfus

<p>Kringspiertyfus started in 2002. The idea of Kringspiertyfus was born in the head of Elmer, who wanted to create deathmetal beyond the borders of extremity. At that time, the year 2002, deathmetal had become some sort of 'trend', how strange this may seem. Because of the overload of the US deathmetal genre (nearly all new bands sounded like Suffocation clones), Elmer wanted to make less technical, but surely more brutal death. The first song of Kringspiertyfus was 'Melting to Death', which was preceded by an intro from the horrorcult 'The Incredible Melting Man'.</p>
<P> When his friends Edgar and Joe Bob heard Melting, they suggested to join Kringspiertyfus. With Joe Bob on bass/grunts, Edgar on guitar/grunts and Elmer on drums/grunts, Kringspiertyfus has formed an utter lompness (extremely rude in dutch) combination. The alternation of extremely slow and ultra fast riffs, the preference for innovative, disgusting and puke-evoking lyrics and finally, the combination of inhuman grunts, makes Kringspiertyfus an original band. Their demo '25" Kitchen Knife' was released in the autumn of 2002 and got so far only positive reactions (see the added review-list).</p>
<P> Kringspiertyfus is: Elmer: Vocals/Drums, Edgar: Vocals/Guitars, Joe Bob: Vocals/Bass.</p>
