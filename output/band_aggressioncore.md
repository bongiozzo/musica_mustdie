### 30.11.2001 news Victim Or Enemy...

<p>Despite having just joined the ranks of Canada’s ANNIHILATOR, former NEVERMORE axeman Curran Murphy has no intention of leaving his longtime outfit AGGRESSION CORE, which is currently in the process of recording its sophomore CD, according to a statement sent by the guitarist to BLABBERMOUTH.NET. The upcoming CD, entitled Victim Or Enemy (the projected artwork for which can be viewed here), is presently being tracked at Murphy’s own Smiley Sounds Studios, and will likely be mixed by either ANNIHILATOR mainman Jeff Waters or STRAPPING YOUNG LAD mastermind Devin Townsend, if Curran has his way. Among the tracks that are tentatively set to appear on Victim Or Enemy are the following: <IMG SRC="/images/news/2001.11/2113.jpg" ALT="pho" width="160" height="160" hspace="15" vspace="5" border="1" align="right"> <BR><BR> 01. Dreaming of Murder <BR> 02. Talk To Me <BR> 03. Victim or Enemy <BR> 04. Dethroned <BR> 05. Life Sentence <BR> 06. (F.ck You) Nazi Boy <BR> 07. Shine <BR> 08. Broken Back <BR> 09. I Hate You <BR> 10. Drunk (instrumental)<BR><BR> According to Curran, two additional, as-yet-untitled cuts will appear on the CD, both of which feature a “more powerful and melodic style” than what the group has done in the past. Although no record deal has yet been secured for the group, Murphy has apparently been “talking with Century Media as well as Nuclear Blast, and we are hoping that through the ANNIHILATOR connection, as well as my history of kicking the sh.t out of people live with NEVERMORE, this will generate the kind of buzz and interest to have one of these labels pick us up and have us tour ourselves to f.cking death!” For more information, and regular studio updates, visit the band’s official web site at www.aggressioncore.com. <BR><BR> Murphy also commented on his departure from NEVERMORE by saying that “I came to the decision to leave the NEVERMORE fold after Jeff Waters offered to have me join ANNIHILATOR as an equal member and to actually get to record on the record with him. In the NEVERMORE zone, it is really all about Jeff, Van, and Jim doing the music, and Warrel doing his lyric work. I don't know of anybody out there who wants to stay in any kind of a job where you can never get a raise or advance your position or do anything to improve your career situation. So I went with ANNIHILATOR.”</p>
