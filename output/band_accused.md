Kai Mathias Stalhammar 30.10.2002 03:29:
Кстати, насчёт гомосексуализма. :-)<BR><BR>November 1999 <BR><BR>ROTTING CHRIST are becoming a political issue in the United States: <BR>Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer recently referred to <BR>ROTTING CHRIST in a speech. Here is what he said: "I could go on and on with such examples, many of them even more repulsive, from the notorious play "Corpus Christi" which depicted Jesus as a homosexual having sex with his Apostles, to a painting displayed at Penn State University showing a Nazi soldier and a Catholic priest standing side-by-side on top of a Jewish victim of the Holocaust. I will leave to your imagination the anti-Catholic garbage promoted by such entertainers as Sinead O'Connor, Madonna and the homosexual musical group (!!!!!! - ED) ROTTING CHRIST." An article is being done about this in The Washington Blade, and ROTTING CHRIST singer Sakis Tolis has already been contacted by the newspaper: "Mr. Tolis, greetings. I am a reporter with the Washington Blade newspaper in Washington, D.C., and I was hoping you could respond to some comments recently made by conservative presidential candidate Gary Bauer. In a speech today, Bauer accused ROTTING CHRIST of being an anti-Catholic "homosexual music group." Just for the record, are you or any members of the band gay? And how do you respond to charges that your music is anti-Catholic? Thank you for your assistance. Sincerely, Bill Roundy, News Reporter The Washington Blade". Sakis and his mates (all heterosexuals by the way) are currently preparing the band's official statement.

### Former PANTERA Guitarist DIMEBAG DARRELL Killed

Egorka 10.12.2004 12:44:
"The Dallas Morning News is reporting that the Columbus police are trying to determine whether Nathan Gale, a 25-year-old semipro football player accused of killing DAMAGEPLAN guitarist "Dimebag" Darrell Abbott, was incensed because of last year's breakup of Mr. Abbott's previous band, PANTERA, one of the top metal acts of the 1990s. <BR><BR>"He loved PANTERA. He was like weird, man, about his obsession with PANTERA," said Mike Norris, who frequents a tattoo parlor across the street from Mr. Gale's home in Marysville, a town about 25 miles from Columbus. "I knew the guy was out to lunch, but I can't believe this." <BR><BR>Mr. Gale, a landscaper, mechanic and sometimes bass player who had just made his car payment a day earlier, ran along the stage Wednesday night and yelled something before firing five or six times at Mr. Abbott, 38, from point-blank range. <BR><BR>Abbott died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head, according to the Franklin County coroner's office.<BR><BR>The 6-foot-3, 266-pound gunman had a man in a headlock and appeared to be reloading when the officer shot him in the face with a rifle, a police spokesman said. <BR><BR>The hostage was unharmed, but Jeff Thompson of Dallas, 40, a technician with the band, was killed, as were Erin Halk, 29, a club employee, and fan Nathan Bray, 23. Two others were injured, one critically. <BR><BR>Other victims of Nathan Gale at the Alrosa Villa club Wednesday night: <BR><BR>Jeff Thompson (photo), 40, Dallas. A member of DAMAGEPLAN's road crew who worked security for the last year. <BR><BR>Nathan Bray, 23, Grove City, Ohio. A DAMAGEPLAN fan who went to the club for the group's concert. <BR><BR>Erin Halk, 29, Columbus, Ohio. He worked for the club loading band equipment. <BR><BR>Two others were wounded; one was in critical condition and the other had injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Two others were treated at the scene. "

### DIMMU BORGIR выгнали Вортекса(бас,вокал) и Мустиса(клавиши)

ward 03.09.2009 00:47:
А вот и заявление Боргиров (с оф.сайта группы).Придется в несколько постингов дробить)))<BR><BR>Official Dimmu Borgir Statement <BR>September 02, 2009, 11:56:55 by webmaster in . <BR><BR>Man, what a shit storm response! <BR><BR>Too bad all the shit is thrown in the wrong direction.<BR><BR>Oh well, what else could we expect? We don?t blame you as you still haven?t heard the other side, the band?s side. We have put up with unprofessionalism and bad live performances for years. This couldn?t be ignored anymore as we firmly believe the fans deserve the best on both records and shows.<BR><BR>First of all, a big thank you to those who still have their own mind intact and believe in the music of the band and not only judge by what is falsely accused in statements posted online by recently fired members based on their ignorance, bitterness and greed. A quite normal human response when being disappointed but we hope you kept in mind the saying that goes: <BR><BR>?Those who scream the loudest have the most to hide??<BR><BR>but:<BR><BR>?Only when we?re calm we?ll be able to listen.?<BR><BR>We have a feeling, judging from some of you and your ?jump to conclusion?- type of comments and responses, that some of the reasons that are about to be explained might as well end up as too much for you band member ?fans? to grasp the magnitude of, or to handle. We?ll give it a try. The true fans of the band and its music already have shown their support and understanding without us having to explain it to them in detail. But for the rest, anyways, here goes:<BR><BR>Let us give you a few things to chew on - perhaps especially to those of you that have already taken sides. Some of it concerns both Vortex and Mustis collectively; some of it is separately based issues. And yes, it might come as a surprise to some of you but they were fired with a reason.<BR><BR>To make it seem less of a soap opera and less embarrassing, if this is even possible at this point, for those it concerns, we?ll keep things simple and straight-to-the-point. On a side note and in comparison, just keep in mind that people have been fired for way less in this and other bands before. So for those of you who think we didn?t try and make this work and did this out of anything else but what we thought was best for the band, please think again and consider the following written words below carefully.<BR><BR>At the same time, as we hate to ruin the idea of how some of you guys perceive this band and its members both in a positive and negative way, those of you who care deserve to hear the truth and here are a few excerpts, out of many, we might add.<BR><BR>Let?s put things in perspective for a second: For someone to be in a band, on any level, first there?s got to be commitment and dedication, a drive and urge to do what you do, whether you?re part of the song writing process, planning the touring part, business part, the administrative part or simply just the performing part ? doesn?t matter which one you?re mostly involved in. However, you need to be involved in some of it to a certain extent to be considered and treated as a member and you have to show some sort of level when it comes to responsibility, not only for yourself but for others around you as well. <BR>Over the course of 10 years period, there?s also something you either develop the comprehension of or you don?t (most develop this basic approach way sooner), called ?understanding of how things are run.? We know it sounds blunt, but it?s important that this is being enforced on behalf of everyone involved within a band and its working partners. After time, you?ve got to know and accept your place and what role you have taken and your ability therein; the sooner you do this, the better. Remember, you still - at the same time - have to continue to earn your place and work for it, respect it and nurture it like a child, even after years of success. It doesn?t come for free, it doesn?t stay for free and it doesn?t leave for free either. We?re all replaceable. <BR><BR>
