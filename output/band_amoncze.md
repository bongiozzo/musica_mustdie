### 04.11.2002 reviews A kind of CD you don’t expect to be released by AMON

<p>A CD you don’t expect to be released by AMON (previously known as “Amon Goeth”… as if anyone doesn’t know that). At least I was sort of surprised when checking out the newer songs. KRABATHORish death metal. Executed at Exponent. I beg your pardon, but why doesn’t Dr.FE sing here? Where has that unique AMON spirit gone? And finally, what does it have to do with black metal?! Later on, everything gets better, mostly because “Nabozne Svine”, “Na Hrobe” and “Steve Ryder” are taken off “Call The Master” demo (1992; later re-released by Nazgul’s Eyrie in the shape of CD) which I once liked a lot. Then we have two more older tracks, also sung by Dr.FE, however these ones had a lesser impact on me due to the fact they’ve been horribly recorded. And then… well, doesn’t the CD say it’s comprised of 12 tracks? Well, it does say, however there’s a lot of bonus tracks. So, all in all, “Zrozeni Smrti” doesn’t seem to be an all-new album, but more likely a sort of compilation. Therefore: no mark.</p>
