### 18.11.2011 news AUSTRIAN DEATH MACHINE to release &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;; available digitally and on limited 7&quot; vinyl

<P>The one and only Austrian Death Machine spent some time in the studio recently, mostly to lift weights, but also to record a few new songs. The songs are based on the ultimate holiday movie, "Jingle All the Way", which stars Ahhnold, of course! The songs are a regaling tale of the pursuit of a one "Turbo Man" doll, sung by Tim Lambesis and Ahhnold.</P>
<P>The digital version of "Jingle All the Way" will be available for download wherever downloads are sold as of December 6th, 2011 and the limited 7" vinyl single will be available shortly thereafter and can be pre-ordered now. This piece of vinyl will be the perfect stocking-stuffer for the most brutal of friends and family. Ahhnold only asks that the vinyl not be gifted to "puny wimps" or "girly men".</P>
<P>Fans can pre-order the Jingle All the Way 7" now over on metalblade.com/austriandeathmachine and at <A href="http://www.blkmarketmerch.com/collections/austrian-death-machine">http://www.blkmarketmerch.com/collections/austrian-death-machine</A>.</P>
