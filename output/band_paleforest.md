### 23.06.2002 reviews Gothic-blah-blah-blah? No.

<p>Not a kind of band you expect to see in Listenable's roster, isn't it? However, PALE FOREST always deserved a better deal than they had previously inked with Voices Of Wonder. I just hope Listenable are at least a bit more competent label to push PALE FOREST further. As to music; it stayed all the same and simultaneously changed a lot. Basically, "Exit Mould" is gothic metal. Although I guess only saying "it's gothic blah-blah-blah" and finishing the review right thereafter would be quite a mistake. Since it's not JUST "gothic". PALE FOREST offer rich musical canvas, completely bewitching the one daring to give it a listen. Bewitching by it's variety and, in the same time, commonness. They obviously had worked hard to come up with such a diversified and brilliantly arranged CD. And yes, female voice is simply enchanting. A MUST. "A must" for both: those who're into "listenable" music and those who are not ;).</p>

### 10.12.2002 articles &quot;Life on the road is kind of like being on another planet&quot; (Jarle @ PALE FOREST)

<p><I>Band: PALE FOREST <BR> Style: goth / alternative <BR> MUSICA's questions answered by: Jarle Hagen (guitars)</I></p>
<P> <B>Is it the first PALE FOREST interview to the Russian zine?</B></>
<P> - Yes, as far as I can remember it is. We have not been very well represented in Russia before. I hope this can change now. I know Listenable Records have a Russian license, so we will have some presence there.</>
<P> <B>I think that many of our Russian readers didn't have the chance to get acquainted with your band. Despite that you have already 4 albums, I've never seen any of your releases on the shelves of our shops, even in the shape of a pirate MC or CD (which our country is famous for). So, first I will bother you with asking to give us a short historical background about the band? Who? Where? When? And why?</B></>
<P>- Well, you asked for it! Here is the story (taken from www.paleforest.no ): Tommy Jшrgensen and Lars Magnus Jenssen were fed up with their repetitive and psychologically eroding jobs. In '96, wearing pale suits of drunkenness and enjoying severe work-induced depressions they teamed up to lay the foundation for a bandproject. They needed therapy, and an outlet of aggression. To balance the two it quickly became apparent that they needed a female vocalist. With the foundation lain, the hunt for proper band-members commenced. Jarle Hagen, with a recent history of musical madness (UNCLE MEAT and ANT MAN BEE) would probably not be a natural choice under normal circumstances, but nevertheless they gave him the spot as the 2nd guitarist. The three remaining pieces of the puzzle came into place in the form of MARY JANE and future SONIC DEBRIS member Jan Petter Ringvold on keyboards, DEWY FIELD drummer Bernhard and DEWY FIELD bass player, Gunleik's, sister Kristin Fjellseth. With the lineup complete, the time had come to start composing. Something special was definitely brewing right from the start. The songs came pouring out, the name changed from PANGAEA to PALE FOREST and their first gig was just a month or two away. A recording of this first ever PF gig in Raufoss, Norway is told to be out there somewhere. Sometime into '97 it became clear that PF needed another keyboard player. A local jazz-keyboardist (Anders Byfuglien) joined in for a month or two, but the next regular PF member was to be 16 year old Eyvind Brox, a student at a local music college. This has been the permanent line-up ever since.</>
<P> <B>Following the question of the band's history, what's the history of it's name? Do you think that it suits the music you play now?</B></>
<P> - We got it off “Celebration of The Lizard” by Jim Morrison. I’ve seen the phrase in yarn-shops (don’t ask!!!) to describe a color, but that has nothing to do with us <I>(laughs)</I>!</>
<P> <B>Let's turn to your new album "Exit Mould". Many musicians call their latest works their best ones. Can you say the same about "Exit Mould"? What differs this one from you previous works?</B></>
<P> - I think we have the guts to be more honest with the audience and ourselves now. We have moved into a more organic sound over the last year. We’re into those old analog synthesizers and guitar effects. They kind of agree more with you when you play them. The production is fresher, heavier and closer to our livesound. It was recorded in Denmark, in a place called Aabenraa, right at the border with Germany. Our producer, Jacob Hansen was great. He made us do things we normally wouldn’t have dared, and played an important part to the overall sound of the album (along with Mr. Trenchcoat (what a rusty old guy…) and the fabulous Danish beer!). We think (thank God!) that this is by far our strongest album to date.</>
<P> <B>As for me, I liked "Exit Mould" a lot, but while listening to it I always had an impression that you are not only into metal. Following the traditions of THE GATHERING and LACUNA COIL, you managed to find your own sound which is sometimes far of dealing with heavy metal. Soft guitar riffs, tender vocals, keyboards and acoustic passages - one might attribute it to some gothic influences. I would hardly do so. It all reminds me more of the bands like MASSIVE ATTACK, PORTISHEAD, HOOVERPHONIC... (Maybe, I m wrong, since I'm not an expert in that kind of music). So, what are you faves both among metal and non-metal bands and which of them, probably, influenced your music?</B></>
<P> - Thank you! People tend to label us “Goth-metal” just cause it’s convenient. You go a little bit deeper and discover it is simply not the case! As influences go, it’s a total mess…We have six different “top 10 lists” that changes weekly. The list of artists may vary from extreme-metal geniuses STRAPPING YOUNG LAD, through BLACK SABBATH, SEPULTURA, Tory Amos, Frank Zappa, Jeff Buckley, EX-GIRL, Beck, MOTORPSYCHO, RADIOHEAD, Robert Johnson, Jimi Hendrix and Shostacowich just to name a few.</>
<P> <B>Why did you choose the studio in Denmark? Was there a special reason to go across the sea instead of finding a good studio somewhere in your area like you did while recording your previous works? (Or, maybe, you all have such a big passion for travelling ;) ?)</B></>
<P> - We had never heard of Jacob Hansen and Aabenraa Studiet before. Laurent (Listenable boss) wanted a studio with a heavier background, shopped around a bit and settled for Aabenraa Studiet and Jacob. We just took his word for it and went. Sometimes you just need to take a chance!</>
<P> <B>Did you enter the studio having already a completely finished and rehearsed material or, maybe, you left some field for improvisations and experiments during the recording?</B></>
<P> - Both, actually. We did a pre-production in Norway, which was very thorough so we came in the studio extremely well prepared. The recording was quicker than planned though, so we had a day to just fool around! That resulted in “Holy Summer” and “Mistaken Identity”. I think both discipline and playtime should be important foundations for a band.</>
<P> <B>I know that you played some shows supporting THE GATHERING. What kind of experience was it for the band? Are THE GATHERING a good company to have an after-show party with?</B></>
<P> - THE GATHERING is a band that we have great respect for, so when they wanted us to go touring with them it was a great opportunity for us. It was a lot of fun, and they were kind and helpful both on and off stage. Due to economy we could only do 4 gigs, but it was absolutely worth the trip! Especially the German audiences were magnificent… We were just the support-act, and they still wanted us to do encores! Amazing… The after-show parties were fun, especially Bielefeld! Plants out the window, and non-stop booze! It ended with Bernhard doing wheelies naked in the hotel-doorway <I>(laughs)</I>… We are still in touch, and maybe we will do something together in the future.</>
<P> <B>What about the "Exit Mould" promotional tour? Does your new label care about such things and are you satisfied with your collaboration with Listenable Rec.?</B></>
<P> - The budgets for small companies simply do not have promo tours in them. What we need to do in stead is to do interviews on the phone and by mail, and push publications to review our album. That has worked out great! I think we have done about 100 interviews since November, and the reviews both domestic and abroad are fantastic. We have much more press now than following our previous releases. We’re played on Indonesian radio, and I’m now chatting with a Russian, so I call our press-strategy a success for now. We need to play gigs too of course, and we plan to do some. Stay tuned to www.paleforest.no for announcements!</>
<P> <B>It was a bit surprising for me to learn that your vocalist Kristin, apart from singing, also plays the guitar at your live performances. Introducing the third guitarist seems quite an unusual practice, doesn't it, especially when it is a girl. Is Kristin as good in guitar playing as she is in singing?</B></>
<P> - That line-up can only be used on certain songs. There is usually not room for a third guitarist. It works out live, and she does a great job! She is primarily the singer, though…</>
<P> <B>In this respect I also wonder whether your live sound differs a lot from what we can hear on the album?</B></>
<P>- The sound on our current album is very close to our livesound. We wanted to capture the nerve and energy somehow, and I think we succeeded.</>
<P> <B>You released 4 albums during 4 years, which means that you devote a lot of time to music. Does it also mean that music brings you enough money to pay the bills and if not - how do you manage to combine it with your permanent jobs?</B></>
<P> - Good question! We need our dayjobs, so you could say we work full-time twice! We somehow get through though…</>
<P> <B>Do you spend your spare time with your band mates or, maybe, on the contrary, after all those rehearsals, gigs, recordings etc. you feel tired of each other (which is quite natural, I think) and try to spend it with someone else?</B></>
<P> - Life on the road is kind of like being on another planet. When the astronauts comes home (or in your case cosmonauts) they can’t stand on their feet, cause the gravity they’ve been avoiding so long hits them upside their heads. To come home from a tour (with its own sets of laws and ways things work) gives me that feeling mentally when I suddenly have to buy toilet paper and pay the rent! It’s good to have someone to share that down period with, so we do hang together outside of band activities, but we also need to see other people.</>
<P> <B>Do you feel lucky to live in Norway? What are, in your opinion, the positive and the negative sides of living there?</B></>
<P> - I feel lucky to live in a country with a stable (though boring and over-protective) government and with no armed conflict waiting to happen. I don’t think Norwegians are enough aware of how lucky we are. You should hear the level of debate in this country! They seem to think the price of tobacco and alcohol is the most important thing to argue about, while people are hungry and USA goes canacas with its arsenal to make things “better”…</>
<P> <B>What is the current stereotype of Russia in Norway and what is the attitude to the Russians among your compatriots?</B></>
<P> - We don’t know anywhere near enough about one of the most important nations in the world! We just hear about you when there are some kind of problem (the Mafia, the nuclearplants, your drunken ex-president, skiers on drugs…). Current affairs regarding young people for instance is nowhere to be found in our media. If you get more webzines in English it would help, I think. "Musica" and “Vae Solis” are good examples! Get the word out!</>
<P> <B>Final words for VAE SOLIS readers...</B></>
<P> - It’s great to finally have an interview in Russia! We hope to come over sometime and do a gig. Cheers!</>
