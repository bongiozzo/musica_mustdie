### 22.08.2002 news Update from Haste...

<p>Here's an update from Haste:<BR> <BR> "We are going to be taking the month of August to work on new songs, some fun things we've been wanting to do for a while, and return to work and pay some of the bills we let pile up over the last month...The month of July was memorable to say the least. We started with Bloodlet, Skycamefalling, and Atreyu here in Birmingham and went up the east coast to Hellfest in Syracuse, NY. We ended the month with our old friends Codeseven back home at Furnace Fest 2002. By the way, if you came down for the fest and you had never been here before, we hope you enjoyed the heart of Dixie. We met lots of new friends and played with and got to see a lot of amazing bands. We will be posting a few pictures from the road in the next few days. A side-note to remember, at one point we had decided not to shave from the first day of tour until Furnace Fest. We each made it up to the Codeseven dates and realized this idea to be one of the worst we had ever had and promptly shaved. Sorry if we looked exceedingly revolting or frightened any small children. Furnace Fest was an incredible amount of fun. Chris wrecked his ankle the second song in and for a while we thought it was broken. I wish I had a picture of how swollen it was. He finished the set with a really bad sprain that will take months to heal. I found out later that our friend Patrick got home from France in the middle of our set and he walked straight into the middle of the pit. Thank you to everyone who made that day so special. That pretty much wraps up our touring until September when we head back to the Northeast to play with some dates with Boysetsfire, and Glassjaw. Snapcase will also be on some dates. The dates we have so far are posted in the shows section, more info and dates to and from coming soon. If you'd like us to play in your town email hastebooking@aol.com.<BR><BR> The song 'Engine' in on the new MTV Road Rules soundtrack...If you haven't seen it yet we do have a video for 'Engine' that we made ourselves in the downloads section. It's lower quality for downloading so if anyone happens to know how we can get the full version on any video channels, let me know, haste7@aol.com. We have some new pictures in the photos section. We NEED YOUR PICTURES!!!! and video, etc.... If you have any of these, please email ryan at ivey205@aol.com. We would love to see them.<BR><BR> We hope to have some new shirts for the September shows and we need your help. Design the Haste t-shirt you would like to see most and send it to ryan at ivey205@aol.com. It doesn't matter what it contains, just have fun. Parodies, puff-paint, glow in the dark, boy shirt, girl shirt, whatever you want to do, just have fun. If we pick your shirt design we will get it made as our next shirt. We have to have the design done in plenty of time to get them made so try to get them to us in the next week/2 weeks or we won't have time to get them printed. If all goes well we will have the shirt at the shows and also available with all the other merchandise which we will be posting on this site again when we get back."</p>

### 21.12.2002 news Haste are recording new material

<p>Currently HASTE have been holed up at home working on new material for their next release. HASTE have around ten songs completed and are currently looking into producers. They just played a local radio sponsored show in Alabama with The Used this past week in front of a sold-out crowd. For an advance taste of what is to come be sure to check out the two new mp3s posted in the media section of their website. These songs are more of an indication of where the band is headed on the new record and fans will not be disappointed in any way. The band plan to announce recording and touring plans early next year.</p>

### 18.06.2003 news HASTE have recently solidified a spot at this year’s prestigious Hellfest ...

<p>HASTE have recently solidified a spot at this year’s prestigious Hellfest that will take place at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, NY on July 4th through the 6th. The dynamic Birmingham, Alabama sextet will play alongside today’s premier hardcore and metal acts including (Thursday, Dillinger Escape Plan, Soilwork, In Flames). After a monumental performance at the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival the group recently embarked on The Radio Takeover tour that will run through June 15th with This Day Forward, Bear Vs. Shark and Anatomy of a Ghost. Hailed by Alternative Press as one of the summer’s crucial discs, The Mercury Lift, arrives in stores July 1st. <BR><BR> Kelly Reaves (vocals) checks in with the following tour report:<BR><BR> “This past New England Metal and Hardcore Fest was the most memorable for us. From seeing our friends Shadows Fall, KSE, Lamb of God, Himsa, BHBS, Shai Hulud, to playing again in front of an always welcoming and amazing bunch of people made us feel completely at home. We were looking forward to playing but we had no idea how much fun it would turn out to be. We had a blast as always but when Randy from LOG walked up and took the mic for his parts we lost it. He is an amazing presence on stage and an even more amazing person. I hope everyone else had as great of an experience as we did. We look forward to seeing everyone out on The Radio Takeover dates and expect us to remain on the road through the end of the year.” The Mercury Lift, the band’s third full-length release, is now available in streaming format on the recently launched www.themercurylift.com website.</p>
