<p>Former TESTAMENT/DEATH/OBITUARY guitarist James Murphy has reportedly been diagnosed with an undisclosed type of brain tumor and is said to be at home in Florida recovering from a recent emergency operation that is believed to have successfully prevented the disease from progressing to a more advanced stage. At the time of Murphy’s diagnosis, the axeman was said to be working on the material for a long-awaited sophomore offering from his death metal project DISINCARNATE—also set to feature an appearance by former AT THE GATES and current THE CROWN frontman Tomas Lindberg—for a 2002 release through Nuclear Blast Records. It is presently unclear what impact this latest development will have on the guitarist’s future recording plans. Source: BLABBERMOUTH.NET</p>

### 28.03.2003 news Former TESTAMENT Guitarist Keeps Busy Despite Medicine ...

<p>Former TESTAMENT/DEATH guitarist James Murphy, who is currently receiving treatment for a massive brain tumor with which he was diagnosed in August 2001, has sent us the following update on his recent activities: <BR><BR> "I am home after over 3 months in NY, where I was meant to run a studio for a friend of mine. I did take over the day-to-day operation of the studio and all was well on that front except that I never had much time to work on my DISINCARNATE material. That's just one of the unfortunate realities of doing business sometimes. I ultimately decided that the best place for me to be able to complete that writing was here in Florida, in my own environment, with no other responsibilities over my head, and where I wasn't intruding on others' space, time, and resources. Besides those reasons, and more importantly, I was having trouble to get my medicine in NY. I had bought a few months supply with the generous donations from my fans who have helped me but I ran out of both my prescriptions while up there, and I am still out now. i hope to be able to get more very soon, and in fact it's very, very important that I find some way to do so because stopping the use of Parlodel, my primary medication, can lead to rapid regrowth of the tumor. Anyway, everything was left on good terms in NY and the door is open for me to return to do more work in the studio. in fact i may return briefly shortly after I can get some more medicine in order to perform some more guitar (I have already recorded several rhythm/harmony parts) on the upcoming debut release of HAVOCHATE, should they decide they need more parts from me, and/or any production assistance.<BR><BR> "The last job i completed before returning home was to mix and master the upcoming debut release on Crash, Inc./Pavement Records of the band SINGLE BULLET THEORY from Pennsylvania. It came out great despite me having limited time to do it and will be out fairly soon.<BR><BR> "These guys' music struck a chord in me right off the bat, and I was very happy to be able to mix their album but it almost didn't happen... because of the problems re-filling my medicine in NY, and it looked like I would have to return to FL before I would have a chance to do the mix. Luckily, at the last minute I was able to stay longer but I had lost a lot of time and had to really knuckle down to get the job done. It was long, long hours but it didn't seem like work... it was just fun, as it always is for me when I enjoy a band's music. Matt and the other guys in SBT showed a lot of faith in me, only the second band to do so since my recovery from a life threatening illness and surgery, when they could have gone to a bigger studio. I am so happy to know that they are so pleased with the results I got for them."</p>
