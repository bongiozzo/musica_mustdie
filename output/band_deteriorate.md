A body is commited to a public mortuary. Any victim of sudden or unexpected<BR>death will be brought in for a post-mortem by a pathologist : their job is to<BR>establish the cause of death. But sometimes a body is unrecognisable. Then it<BR>is vital, especially if murder is suspected, to establish identity...<BR><BR><BR>Insipid fumes bellow from the atrabilious chimney<BR>Whilst in the sanctified crevet I calmly pillage and rake<BR>For hot dry powdered human slag<BR>Still steaming in the crematorium's gate<BR><BR>Bio-organic ebullition, bones tar, tallow dehydrates<BR>For my deleterious horticulture so that I may cultivate<BR><BR>Your mortal mechanism dies - in nutrients rich<BR>In the hallowed turf you lie - just for the taking<BR><BR>Charred sinew's as good as lime, no phosphates do I need<BR>Deteriorated flesh used as top-soil, to replenish and nourish seed<BR>Spreading the human potash, as ash matured<BR>Recycling my rich harvest, bring out your dead - for use as manure<BR><BR>Irrigating tears are shed, but the ground must still be fed,<BR>And there's no rest for the dead<BR><BR>Tipping and dusting up the spilt contents of urns<BR>Every morsel that glows as embers on the fire<BR>Extinguishing all hope of beatrific dispatch<BR>These charred chassis desired<BR><BR>Exequiet rites now performed, a coronach sooting up the flu<BR>Enter my execrable inferno, even in the afterlife there's work to do<BR><BR>The nitrogen content's high - but the flesh is weak<BR>At the graveside mourners cry - your're never to wake again<BR><BR>Burnt brisket renews the ground, to germinate my seed<BR>Cremated bodies are my spoil, to use them as plant feed<BR>Ploughing this abhorrent human manure<BR>Seedling my rich harvest, bring out your dead - for the soils to devour<BR><BR>Dry the dead are bled, because the ground must be fed,<BR>And there's still no rest for the dead<BR><BR>I propagate - dust in the grate<BR><BR>Ashes to ashes - dust to dust, diluted in water and sprayed on crops,<BR>Charcoal, fats, flesh and soot fetilising pasture with active fertile rot<BR><BR>Incumbent - latent calories are spent<BR><BR>Ashes to ashes - dust to dust, renewing the land with corpses corrupt<BR>Mortuary scrapings, hearses a must, to the hot hearth the deceased are trussed<BR><BR>Harvesting the defouled, to fertilise my soil<BR>Rejuvenating the spent with my fecundate spoils<BR><BR>Reaping the gone, to nourish the land<BR>Replenishing exhausted pasture with my uncanny sleight of hand<BR>Restoring the natural balance, sowing my seed<BR>Dafalcating the departed, I rapt and glean...<BR><BR>So I recite my contrite lament, lacrimation for the dead<BR>Their rest which I disturb...<BR>Where should stand row upon row of cold grey remebrance stones<BR>My cash crops now grow...

So a word of advice: For those of you who?d wish and would want to work with either of these guys in the future, please be prepared to discuss business first since the art of music comes secondary. <BR><BR>We believe there?s no need to go into further details; it?ll be highly embarrassing. It already is for the rest of us and most sane people get the point by now. If you feel you haven?t been appreciated, this goes for both, then why did you accept the large sums of money all these years that has been handed out to you? It was convenient, wasn?t it? <BR><BR>For how much longer should we accept a service on stage that has slowly deteriorated over the last few years which we know other bands wouldn?t tolerate, seeing as your performance simply wasn?t good enough and your self critical view was like zero. Explain that.<BR><BR>But you wanted the cash, pretty typical. Give someone something even if they don?t deserve it just to keep everyone happy and they want more of it. Don?t take credit for something you haven?t written. If you knew how to arrange and write a song, you would have already, just like the rest of us. But no, your lazy ass is too ?busy? complaining about not getting what is ?rightfully? and ?legally? yours. <BR><BR>Funny then, how the new album is halfway finished written already by the rest of us without any of these guys? input, still having all those elements we?re known for. Even having obligations and work with other bands simultaneously on the side. <BR><BR>But those who still believe in the band and its music, and not in recently fired members? bitterness, greed and fear of what?s around the corner, will understand this when the next opus is out. We could write a book about previous members? and their separate reasons why they?re not in the band anymore, but we believe you don?t want to hear most of it by now.<BR><BR>This wasn?t an issue of the typical ?musical differences? bullshit statement either. Other bands cover up their shit with that worn out excuse, but musical differences is exactly what makes this band sounding unique. Sadly, some of the members lost the focus along the way; some people close to the band will say they did that a long time ago, and for that there was simply nothing we could do anymore. We can?t force people to do something they obviously don?t want or care about. We tried - but they didn?t. Our patience and goodwill is not everlasting. So for those of you who still think we owe them more than a phone call or an e-mail letting them know their ?services? are no longer wanted and needed, think again. We just had enough and for that we?re not sorry. We?re only sorry it didn?t work out in the end.<BR><BR>And to those who think greed played a part in this, so absolutely, and now you know whose careers are run by it and whose isn?t. <BR><BR>See you soon,<BR>Galder, Shagrath & Silenoz. <BR>

### Будущее

вот еще один этюд в багровых тонах. вероятность сценария 30 на 70% я бы сказал, но вообще-то странно, что такой апокалипсис нарисован именно японцами:<BR><BR><A HREF="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20602081&sid=a_A5nqmw9Dq8" TARGET="_blank">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20602081&sid=a_A5nqmw9Dq8</A><BR><BR>Dollar to Hit 50 Yen, Cease as Reserve, Sumitomo Says (Update1) <BR>Share | Email | Print | A A A <BR><BR>By Shigeki Nozawa<BR><BR>Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar may drop to 50 yen next year and eventually lose its role as the global reserve currency, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.’s chief strategist said, citing trading patterns and a likely double dip in the U.S. economy. <BR><BR>“The U.S. economy will deteriorate into 2011 as the effects of excess consumption and the financial bubble linger,” said Daisuke Uno at Sumitomo Mitsui, a unit of Japan’s third- biggest bank. “The dollar’s fall won’t stop until there’s a change to the global currency system.” <BR><BR>The dollar last week dropped to the lowest in almost a year against the yen as record U.S. government borrowings and interest rates near zero sapped demand for the U.S. currency. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, has fallen 15 percent from its peak this year to as low as 75.211 today, the lowest since August 2008. <BR><BR>The gauge is about five points away from its record low in March 2008, and the dollar is 2.5 percent away from a 14-year low against the yen. <BR><BR>“We can no longer stop the big wave of dollar weakness,” said Uno, who correctly predicted the dollar would fall under 100 yen and the Dow Jones Industrial Average would sink below 7,000 after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. last year. If the U.S. currency breaks through record levels, “there will be no downside limit, and even coordinated intervention won’t work,” he said. <BR><BR>China, India, Brazil and Russia this year called for a replacement to the dollar as the main reserve currency. Hossein Ghazavi, Iran’s deputy central bank chief, said on Sept. 13 the euro has overtaken the dollar as the main currency of Iran’s foreign reserves. <BR><BR>Elliott Wave <BR><BR>The greenback is heading for the trough of a super-cycle that started in August 1971, Uno said, referring to the Elliot Wave theory, which holds that market swings follow a predictable five-stage pattern of three steps forward, two steps back. <BR><BR>The dollar is now at wave five of the 40-year cycle, Uno said. It dropped to 92 yen during wave one that ended in March 1973. The dollar will target 50 yen during the current wave, based on multiplying 92 with 0.764, a number in the Fibonacci sequence, and subtracting from the 123.17 yen level seen in the second quarter of 2007, according to Uno. <BR><BR>The Elliot Wave was developed by accountant Ralph Nelson Elliott during the Great Depression. Wave sizes are often related by a series of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence, pioneered by 13th century mathematician Leonardo Pisano, who discerned them from proportions found in nature. <BR><BR>Uno said after the dollar loses its reserve currency status, the U.S., Europe and Asia will form separate economic blocs. The International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights may be used as a temporary measure, and global currency trading will shrink in the long run, he said
