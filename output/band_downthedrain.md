### Что крутого в ROSSOMAHAAR?

<BR><BR><BR>Here's one of the latest emails I got from Markus: <BR><BR>"Karsten told me he couldn't transfer yet, but he will be trying to transfer<BR>this friday or at least on monday. Sorry for that trouble, but we had to pay<BR>lots of studio costs the last weeks and we are no major label. I wanna be<BR>honest with you, so please wait these some more days." (Mon, 12 Sep 2001) <BR>  <BR>Well, needless to say, money were never transferred to our account. And, by<BR>the way, what studio costs had they been covering?? <BR>  <BR>I mean, lately I've emailed many bands that are / were signed to LEP the<BR>same kind of message (see below), and here's what they say: <BR><BR>"Salve. <BR>Kai's here @ Rossomahaar. <BR>Recently we have inked a deal with Last Episode, and now it seems like <BR>it was a mistake. A HUGE mistake. As far as I know, you also have (had?) <BR>certain problems with Karsten's behavior and unwillingness to cover the <BR>studio expenditures. Could you please tell me more on this subject? <BR>Would be much appreciated. <BR><BR>Respect, <BR>Kai" <BR><BR>Clemens / AMORTIS <BR><BR>"Actually I cannot tell when or if Last Episode is going to pay you. I have<BR>had more negative than positve experience with the label and "letting you<BR>wait" seems to be one of their prior label philosphy :-( <BR>There is many rumor that LE are going down the drain / having much financial<BR>problems... but I cannot say whether this is true or not. As they were not <BR>paying us for such a long time and our studio (of course) wanted to get <BR>their money we finally decided to stop working with them and to look for <BR>another label. Actually I'd strongly suggest to keep away from LE as the <BR>relation to their bands is very impersonal too. We always had to phone them<BR>or contact them to keep informed about latest news etc. and their was never<BR>feedback about our material and so on... We do not seem to be the only band <BR>who had these problems as acts like SUIDAKRA or NEBULAR MOON also decided to<BR>part from LE. Furthermore AEBA were telling me about the same troubles." <BR>
