### 05.04.2003 news DVS Records signs 3 new bands

<p>Official postment: We are proud to announce 3 new sigings. First we signed German ambient gothic band DESPAIRATION, to release a new album in November of this year. The album will be entitled "Music For The Night" and is a philosophical-literary concept album which describes the spiritual journey through one intitial night. Secondly we have signed the young Italian progressive metal band DYNAMIC LIGHTS, who have released a well-received EP last year, entitled "Resurrection". We will release a full-length album in spring 2004. And last but not least we signed ASCENSION THEORY, a project of the USA by members of the progband Aztec Jade. They released an album on their own last year and we will release the second one someday in 2004.</p>
