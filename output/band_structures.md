Tracklist from Remedy Lane:<BR>* Of Two Beginnings<BR>     CHAPTER I:<BR>* Ending Theme <BR>* Fandango<BR>* Trace of Blood<BR>* This Heart of Mine   (I Pledge)<BR>     CHAPTER II:<BR>* Undertow<BR>* Rope Ends <BR>* Chain Sling <BR>* Dryad of the Woods<BR>* Thorn Clown (Japanese Bonus)<BR>     CHAPTER III:<BR>* Remedy Lane<BR>* Waking every God<BR>* Second Love<BR>* Beyond the Pale<BR><BR>The concept is the most personal so far by Pain of Salvation, and that says a lot. More emotions than ever, and as usual more focused on content and poetic values than on empty symbols and useless metal props. The lyrics deal with a crisis in a relationship and the difficulties in finding the right way through life. It is like a mixture of TPE, John Bauer, Romeo and Juliet and Daniel's essay "Structures of Decision" that is available for download here in the Kingdom. Add a subtle but weird Eastern European touch and a few bitter drops of folk music, rap and techno and you ... will probably still not get the picture, right? :)<BR><BR>

### ARCTURUS без Гарма - ваши прогнозы?

мдя...<BR><BR>13.02.2003   ULVER founder Garm (aka Tricky G) leaves ARCTURUS<BR>Ulver founder Garm (also known as Tricky G) has announced that he has left Arcturus. In an exclusive interview with BW&BK Garm revealed that there are no hard feelings regarding his decision to quit the band. The split is simply due to time restraints, or as Garm himself told it to BW&BK: "I had to choose and down-prioritize a few things. My record label, Jester Records, has 30 CDs in the catalogue and I really want to work with my artists first hand, because I believe in all of them. Arcturus was ok as an offspring project, but the other members have tried to get serious about it now. They want to rehearse three times a week, and I can't commit to that. I'm not happy with this move, but it's something that has to be done."<BR><BR>In releated Ulver news, the band's next album is entitled "Utopian Enterprises". In the same BW&BK interview Gram described the album as "filthy. It won't be violent musically, but it will be violent in other ways. We're returning to more conventional song-structures, but we'll still be trying to take the sound of things further."
