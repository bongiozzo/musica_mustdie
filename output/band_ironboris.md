### 22.08.2016 news Debut of IRON BORIS

<p><strong>IRON BORIS</strong> is a five-piece heavy metal band from Helsinki, Finland and their nonanticipated, beer-stenched debut “The Road to Valhцll” will hit the shelves on the 7th of September 2016.</p><p>The players have spent several years in libraries rather than bars, but also with different outfits playing punk/hc, indie and alternative. However now the call of real, nasty, passionate heavy metal has finally brought them together. After they roll sleeves and adjust their glasses, the intense power of heavy metal blasts out of this bunch like never before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Hereґs what vocalist Asmo had to say about the record: “<em>This is definitely one of our best works, maybe the hardest. Iґd give it&nbsp;a strong B+. Satanic heavy rock by a bunch of beer-commies. Straight out of the curve deep into the woods. Ingest black vomit and get your metal out!”</em></p><p>The record is released and distributed by the bandґs own We Are The Trail in cooperation with Tampere-based Rдmekuukkeli.</p><p>center><iframe width="60%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/277065423&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe>
