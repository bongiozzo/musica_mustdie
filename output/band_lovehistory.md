### Doom-metal мертв?

Последний альбом "моего доброго брата" - элементарная подстава, испугались, что распугали фэнов своим предыдущим трипхопом, лэйбл надавил - и возвращение к корням готово. Норвежская заДУМчивость - того же пошиба... На мой взгляд, последние искренние группы этой стилистики творят в Восточной Европе: Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy, Love History, Morgain, Mournful Gust... Рулят!!!

That time it was more funny Noisecore than something serious. In 1992 the band becomes more serious grindcore with pathological lyrics. No one remember what line up was as first but first serious was : Bilos - Guitar/Vox, Roman - Bass and Libor - Drums. After some demos in '95 both left the band because they weren't interested in grindcore anymore. Libor is now in his death band Temple of Sorrow and Roman plays at pop stars band Endless. Michal - Drums and Otto - Bass joined the Bilos as new MT's members. This line up made many records and shows in Czech or abroad. In 1997 band changed their lyrics from pathological topics to more socialy aware lyrics against homophobia, racism, fascism and world system which enslave people around the world.In the same year Michal left the band to focus on his own band called Cerebral Turbulency. Quick replacement is named Marek. Few weeks after Michal, Otto also left the band as well. He is still active in his grindcore band Needful Things. Because there were no bassplayers interested in grindcore Bilos took over the bass and new face on guitar is Richard. Many shows and records as always and in '99 Marek left the band without the reason and in spring 2000 Richard left as well to focus on his own band called Love History. So Bilos has to look for new members and within the month new drummer Michal(6Mas, Carnal Diafragma, Jezus Crust) and guitarist Marek(Purulent Spermcanal) were found but Marek was kicked out after few shows. Bilos took the guitar back and new bassplayer Petr was found in local band called Hibakusha. But Petr stayed only few months and after one european tour he left. Band is stagnant. Bilos is moving to Belgium where he is trying to put on new line up without succes. Then he moving to Holland where he found two brothers Johan - Drums and Jelle - Bass/Vox and they continue to grind the core. In this line up MT recorded first full lenght album "DAWN OF A NEW AGE"(2003) which is good portion of dirty crust/grind from hell. After many succesfull shows and some more records Bilos is moving back to Czech Republic. In summer 2003 Simek taking the place in a band as bassplayer. He is known as former member of Cerebral Turbulency. Then Marsel as drummer joining the band. With this line up MT's music a bit change to more dirty Crust ' n roll with hellbooze lyrics. You can hear it at 7"EP "HAMMER AND ANVIL"(2004). Unfortunately in late summer 2004 Marsel tragicaly died. So new member David taking over the drumkit. Metallic dirty Crust 'n roll you can hear at second full lenght called "BURNINHELL"(2005) where Koral played leads as guest and in summer 2006 he join the band as official member. Together MT recording new material called R 'N 'R ENGINE.<BR>
